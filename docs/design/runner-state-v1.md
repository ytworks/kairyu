# Runner State v1

`RunnerState` is Kairyu's logical view of one inference-serving Runner. It is
not a projection of Kubernetes Pod phase: a running container remains
`image_pull`, `model_loading`, or `warming` until the corresponding serving
evidence is complete.

This slice fixes the controller-neutral contract, a read-only Kubernetes
observation/reconciliation boundary, a fence-bound drain/termination handshake,
bounded failure-domain backoff/quarantine, and a lease-fenced single-writer
boundary. It also defines the immutable model-class scaling policy, observation
window, durable decision-log boundary, and leader-fenced scale actuation.
Durable Runner-state persistence and Kubernetes termination writes remain later
work.

## Identity and snapshot rules

Every `RunnerStatus` carries opaque but non-empty `runner_id`, `release_id`,
`model_id`, and `model_revision` values. Node, Pod UID, and GPU UUIDs are
optional while scheduling is incomplete. GPU UUIDs must be unique. The status
schema is explicitly tagged `runner-status-v1`.

Snapshots are immutable, reject unknown fields, and use timezone-aware,
monotonic observation times. `state_version` advances only when the logical
state changes; an idempotent observation of the same state updates
`observed_at` without manufacturing a transition. Runtime evidence carries
its independent source timestamp and a persisted payload fingerprint. An
equal-timestamp replay is accepted only when its complete payload is identical,
including after controller restart.

`ready` means startup evidence is complete and `active_requests` is zero.
`busy` requires complete startup evidence and at least one active request.
`draining` and `unhealthy` may retain a non-zero count so a controller does not
erase in-flight work while removing the Runner from new dispatch. An
`unhealthy` snapshot requires a bounded, sanitized failure and other states
forbid one. Fatal failures may additionally declare a `revision`, `node`, or
`gpu` domain for restart protection. State updates inherit the prior active
count unless the caller supplies a newly observed value; entering `ready`,
`terminating`, or `terminated` from a non-empty snapshot therefore requires an
explicit zero.
Any snapshot with active work requires complete startup evidence, including
while draining or unhealthy.

## State transitions

```text
requested → scheduling → image_pull → model_loading → warming → ready ↔ busy
     │            │           │              │           │        │
     └────────────┴───────────┴──────────────┴───────────┴──→ draining
          active states ────────────────────────────────→ unhealthy

ready/busy → draining → terminating → terminated
unhealthy  → draining
```

Self-transitions are accepted as idempotent observations. Skipping readiness
stages, changing a fenced draining Runner back to unhealthy, returning it to
service, or resurrecting a terminated Runner is rejected. Fatal evidence found
during drain is recorded operationally while the logical drain remains sticky;
recovery creates a new Runner generation/status rather than rewriting fenced or
terminated history.

## Startup phase report

The versioned `runner-startup-v1` report decomposes cold start into this
canonical, gap-free order:

1. `image_pull`
2. `model_fetch`
3. `model_load`
4. `graph_compile`
5. `warmup`

Each phase has a start time and either remains in progress or ends as
`succeeded`, `failed`, or `skipped`. A failure is terminal and requires a
bounded sanitized error. `image_pull` and `model_load` cannot be skipped;
cache-hit model fetch, eager-mode graph compilation, and an explicitly disabled
warmup must still be represented as `skipped`, so missing telemetry cannot be
mistaken for success.

The report rejects duplicates, gaps, overlap, future timestamps, more than one
in-progress phase, and any phase after failure. Helper functions return new
reports rather than mutating prior evidence. Once attached to a Runner status,
updates must stay in the same startup attempt and monotonically extend its phase
history. Completed phases are immutable; a new startup attempt requires a new
Runner generation instead of replacing prior evidence. A phase completion or
new phase start also cannot be backdated before the preceding observation.

## Read-only Kubernetes observation and reconciliation

`KubernetesRunnerWatcher` issues only authenticated Pod and EndpointSlice LIST
requests. It rotates the projected service-account token on every poll and
joins resources by the stable Pod UID. Polls are single-flight; when either
LIST fails, its sibling is cancelled and joined before the poll lock is
released. Every successful full-list epoch records a watcher identity,
monotonic epoch number, both Kubernetes resource versions, source-start time,
and completion time. This remains explicit when the selected fleet is empty,
allowing the reconciler to distinguish a confirmed empty list from a failed or
missing poll. The source-start time prevents slow I/O from refreshing old
Kubernetes evidence.

Managed Pods publish immutable deployment identity through these annotations:

- `kairyu.ai/release-id`
- `kairyu.ai/model-id`
- `kairyu.ai/model-revision`
- `kairyu.ai/gpu-uuids`, encoded as a JSON string array once assigned
- `kairyu.ai/runner-container`, required when the Pod has multiple containers

Missing release/model identity, malformed GPU data, duplicate Pod UIDs, an
ambiguous serving container, and unexpected runtime rows reject the entire
observation. The runtime side is deliberately an injected, timeout-bounded,
read-only source: it owns Kairyu readiness, active-request counts, and the
startup report, while Kubernetes owns Pod scheduling/container evidence and
EndpointSlice membership. The watcher may also request runtime/request-store
evidence for tracked Runners whose Pods have disappeared, without treating
those rows as live Pods.

`RunnerStatusReconciler` atomically aggregates each full observation epoch.
Pod phase never decides serving eligibility by itself. A Runner becomes
`ready` or `busy` only when all of the following agree:

1. the Pod is `Running` and Pod-ready;
2. at least one GPU UUID assignment is observed;
3. the Pod UID is a ready, non-terminating EndpointSlice target;
4. Kairyu runtime readiness is true;
5. the complete ordered startup report is present.

Routing eligibility fails closed immediately when any latest serving gate is
false, its evidence is older than the caller's freshness lease, or timestamps
appear to come from the future. The gate age is the conservative minimum of the
Kubernetes source-start time and that Runner's accepted runtime timestamp, so
runtime staleness and routing freshness are not added together. A brief
cross-resource mismatch keeps the lifecycle state stable for a configurable
elapsed-time grace period, but never keeps it routable. Continuous loss past
that grace changes the state to sticky `unhealthy`; it cannot self-resurrect
without a new Runner generation.

Runtime timestamps are accepted only within a bounded age and clock-skew
tolerance. Older or excessively future evidence is unavailable rather than
authoritative. Node and GPU assignment cannot drift for the same Pod UID.
Image pull, crash loop, OOM, GPU Xid, non-zero exit, Pod, startup, and readiness
failures retain distinct bounded reason codes; `lastState.terminated` preserves
the underlying OOM/GPU/exit cause during a CrashLoopBackOff.

A Pod deletion or confirmed full-list disappearance enters and remains
`draining`, preserving identity, startup evidence, and the latest trustworthy
active count. Reconciliation alone never infers `terminating` from a zero count.
`RunnerStatusReconciler.routing_eligible()` exposes the stateful, freshness-
checked `ready | busy` decision for later routing integration.

## Drain and termination handshake

Termination uses three immutable, versioned pieces of evidence:

1. `RunnerDispatchFence` binds a unique fence ID and monotonic sequence to the
   Runner Pod UID, drain-state version, and concrete replica generation. It
   records when new dispatch stopped and routing exclusion completed.
2. `RunnerDrainActivityObservation` binds an authoritative active-request count
   to that exact fence and generation. An observation from before the routing
   exclusion, from another fence, or from a re-added replica is rejected.
3. `RunnerTerminationAuthorization` persists the matching fence and post-fence
   zero evidence in `RunnerStatus`, so authorization remains auditable and
   idempotent across controller restart.

`ReplicaPoolDrainController` is the executable single-pool adapter. Acquiring
its drain lease immediately removes the Runner from new placement and also
invalidates an already-prepared placement lease before backend dispatch. It
retains the lease while observing outstanding work. Its `commit_termination`
operation revalidates the retained fence and replica generation, reads zero,
and creates authorization without an asynchronous yield between those steps.
The backend-neutral `RunnerDrainController` protocol requires the same atomic
commit boundary from a production shared dispatcher/request store; that
implementation must use one transaction or compare-and-swap operation across
the durable fence, generation, active count, and authorization record.

`RunnerStatusReconciler.authorize_termination()` delegates to that atomic commit
and accepts only a `draining` status with matching post-fence
`active_requests == 0`. Stale zero observed
before the fence, a non-zero count, a different Pod/generation/state version,
or evidence older than the latest runtime observation fails closed. The
resulting `terminating` status must carry the persisted authorization; only a
subsequent full Kubernetes epoch that confirms Pod disappearance advances it
to `terminated`.

This slice mutates local `ReplicaPool` eligibility but does not patch or delete
Kubernetes objects, choose a replica count, persist controller status, or elect
a writer. A multi-gateway deployment must implement the protocol with a shared,
durable dispatch fence before using its authorization for Pod deletion.

## Crash backoff and failure-domain quarantine

`RunnerFailureGuard` consumes immutable `unhealthy` transitions. A transition
is counted exactly once by `runner_id + state_version`; an exact replay is
idempotent and a conflicting replay fails closed. A separate window-bounded
observation tombstone retains this identity even when a domain has no action or
its bounded event list evicts the original row. Tombstone capacity overflow is
rejected atomically rather than weakening deduplication. The stateful reconciler
submits its complete updated view through `record_many()` before committing its
own state, so a guard capacity/error rejection leaves both components unchanged.
Failure scopes are explicit in `RunnerFailure.domain` rather than inferred from
free-form messages:

- revision failures use the complete `release_id + model_id + model_revision`
  identity, preventing one poisoned release from suppressing another;
- node failures use the stable Kubernetes node name and apply across releases;
- GPU failures use physical GPU UUIDs and apply across nodes/releases. When a
  Pod reports more than one GPU and the source cannot identify the exact device,
  every assigned UUID is conservatively fenced.

The reconciler marks image-pull failures, OOM, crash loops, non-zero container
exit, Pod failure, and fatal runtime readiness as revision-scoped; GPU Xid as
GPU-scoped; and unknown Pod state as node-scoped. Startup-owned failures without
an explicit scope are revision-scoped because their immutable startup report
binds them to the release/model revision. Transient serving-gate loss without a
fatal classification does not poison a domain.

`RunnerBackoffPolicy` bounds the base delay, exponential factor, maximum delay,
failure window, quarantine threshold/duration, retained events per domain, and
total domain count. Before the threshold, `RunnerBackoffDecision` exposes an
exponential `backoff_until`; at the threshold it also exposes a time-bounded
`quarantine_until`. `blocked_domains()` evaluates all currently known revision,
node, and GPU identities for a candidate placement. A capacity overflow raises
instead of silently dropping an active quarantine.

`RunnerFailureGuardSnapshot` serializes the policy, bounded event ledgers, and
quarantine deadlines in deterministic order. Active quarantine retains its
threshold evidence beyond the ordinary failure window, and snapshot validation
reconstructs each bounded domain ledger from the tombstones and recomputes the
exact deadline from that evidence and policy. Restored guards reject clock
rollback, future evidence, changed replays, missing node/GPU identity,
one-sided/corrupt ledgers, and out-of-capacity state. The snapshot is the
persistence seam for the later single-writer controller; this slice itself
performs no database or Kubernetes writes and assumes one event-loop/controller
owner.

## Leader election and single-writer fencing

`RunnerLeaderLeaseStore` is the shared coordination contract for every Runner
controller contender. `acquire()` elects at most one unexpired holder for an
election ID, `renew()` extends only the same tenure, and `authorize()` uses the
store-owned clock to issue one immediate `RunnerWriterAuthority`. Lease expiry
is exclusive: at `lease_until` the old holder has no authority and takeover may
start. Every takeover or release/reacquire increments a durable, monotonic
`fencing_token`; renewal never changes it.

Controller `holder_id` values must be globally unique per live process (for
example Pod UID plus process boot UUID). The production store must be shared,
linearizable, durable across controller restarts, retain token tombstones, and
derive all expiry decisions from its own authoritative clock. The included
`InMemoryRunnerLeaderLeaseStore` is a bounded, thread-safe executable
specification for tests and single-process development; it is not an HA backend.
`PostgresRunnerLeaderLeaseStore` is the production implementation: each
environment uses an explicit store ID, PostgreSQL advisory locks and row locks
serialize contenders, `clock_timestamp()` owns expiry, and the retained row
preserves the fencing-token tombstone across release and process restart. Store
DDL, catalog checks, and lease operations all use the explicitly qualified
`public` control schema; connection `search_path` cannot select an independent
election. Startup fails closed unless both tables resolve to that namespace and
their relation kind, ordered column types/nullability, primary key, foreign key
target, and validated check constraints exactly match schema version 1. Both
must be permanent rather than unlogged tables so crash recovery cannot reset
the fencing-token tombstone; a version marker alone is not accepted as
readiness evidence. The namespace OID is pinned for the store lifetime and
revalidated after reconnect, preventing silent attachment to recreated state.

`LeaderFencedRunnerController` obtains a freshly store-validated authority
immediately before each synchronous, bounded callback. Validation requires the
exact held tenure and lease deadline and cannot predate its latest renewal. Its
`reconcile()` gate covers both the reconciler and its attached failure guard;
`authorize_termination()` covers the final drain transition; and
`mutate_autoscaler()` is the required entry point for the later scale actuator.
Followers, expired holders, cached/conflicting authority, stale tokens, clock
rollback, capacity exhaustion, and fencing-token regression fail closed before
the callback runs.

The authority check never holds the coordination store lock while application
code runs, so an expired leader cannot prevent takeover by hanging. Therefore
the authority token must be persisted with any external decision and checked
atomically by its mutation target; output from a callback that outlives its
lease is stale even if the local function returns normally. WP3.4 implements
that boundary as `claim_authority() -> observe/decide -> append ->
apply_fenced()`. A successor first advances the token on the workload with a
JSON Patch resourceVersion/UID CAS. That claim response must keep replicas and
the Pod template; its generation follows the workload kind (Deployment advances
it by one on any annotation change, StatefulSet keeps it), and the claim records
the returned generation for the decision fence (review amendment, PR #615). The
actuator then accepts a decision only
when that exact token is still present. Both claim and actuation require one
more store-authoritative reauthorization immediately before PATCH, so expiry
detected by that final pre-PATCH check fails closed even before a successor
claim. Review amendment (PR #615): actuation takes that check after its last
quota, prewarm, startup-binding, or drain callback, and re-evaluates the
freshness of the evidence those callbacks returned against the final authority;
nothing runs between that check and the PATCH. Cluster RBAC
and admission policy remain deployment concerns.

## Model-class scaling policy

`ScalingPolicy` (`runner-scaling-policy-v1`) is the immutable input contract for
one bounded model class. Its durable identity is `(model_class,
policy_revision)`; `ScalingPolicyCatalog` adds a separately versioned, bounded
collection and rejects duplicate class keys. WP3.2 decision records must copy
both the catalog revision and resolved policy identity instead of referring to
mutable configuration by name alone.

The policy separates minimum and maximum replicas, absolute and ratio-based
warm buffer, scale-up delay, idle keep-alive, decision cooldown, maximum
request multiplexing per Runner, and maximum per-decision scale-up/down steps.
`max_observation_age_seconds` fixes the freshness lease in the copied policy,
so replaying a record cannot reinterpret whether its inputs were stale.
The buffer is exactly the larger of `warm_buffer_replicas` and
`ceil(demand_replicas * warm_buffer_ratio)`; the ratio is based on unbuffered
demand replica count capped at `max_replicas`, not current or desired capacity.
The later decision engine will add that buffer, then clamp the target and each
step to the hard bounds. No field in this schema changes the existing
`autoscale_decision()` behavior yet.

The safe default is one fixed warm, non-multiplexed replica. A zero minimum is
valid only when `scale_to_zero=true` and a non-empty measurement/review approval
ID is present. Its absolute buffer must be zero; the ratio buffer still permits
headroom under load but evaluates to zero at zero demand. An approval ID is
rejected when scale-to-zero is disabled. This makes the plan's model-class
approval rule machine-checkable rather than an operator convention. Public
identity, buffer, and catalog lookup paths revalidate serialized content so
unchecked Pydantic copies cannot cross the control-plane boundary.

## Autoscaler observation window and decision log

`ScalingObservation` captures one coherent, source-timestamped input snapshot
for exactly one model class. Queue inputs include total and interactive/batch
depth, oldest age, arrival rate, deadline percentiles, predicted TTFT, and
goodput ratio. Runner inputs retain current, busy, ready, loading, unhealthy,
and draining counts. Optional resource inputs cover GPU, HBM, KV-cache,
multiplexing, and batch occupancy; optional startup inputs retain model-cache
residency and bounded EMA/p95 metrics for each canonical startup phase. Source
timestamps cannot postdate the assembled observation, class counts cannot
exceed their totals, and every numeric field is finite and bounded.

`ScalingObservationWindow` (`runner-scaling-window-v1`) is a non-empty,
time-bounded sequence of these snapshots. Observation times must be strictly
increasing and inside the window, IDs must be unique, and all rows must match
the window model class. A canonical SHA-256 fingerprint binds the complete
window. These rules prevent partial, reordered, cross-class, or unchecked
Pydantic copies from entering a decision.

`ScalingDecisionRecord` (`runner-scaling-decision-v1`) copies the exact window,
catalog revision, and immutable resolved policy rather than pointing at mutable
configuration. It records action, enumerated primary reason and bounded detail,
unbuffered demand, the policy-derived buffered target, desired replicas, and
delta from the latest observed replica count. Validation recomputes the policy
buffer, target delta, min/max bounds, and per-decision step limit. Staleness is
derived from the oldest source timestamp in the latest observation (including
optional resource/startup evidence when present) and the copied policy's
freshness lease; the persisted boolean and reason must agree with that result.
Stale input may hold or perform a policy-step-bounded scale-up, but can never
authorize scale-down. A canonical record fingerprint makes an exact retry
idempotent and a changed retry under the same decision ID a conflict. The log
atomically allocates a per-model `decision_generation` when a scale-up/down
draft is first appended and binds it into that fingerprint. The same record
also embeds the claimed election/token and exact workload kind, namespace,
name, UID, generation, release, and model revision used to decide. HOLD records
are explicitly generation-free and do not consume the mutation sequence. A
caller cannot assign a generation to a new decision.

If a newly resolved policy puts the currently observed replica count outside
its bounds, one decision may remain outside the new range only while moving by
at most the configured step toward the nearest bound. Holding is still valid
when a freshness or cooldown safety rule prevents mutation. Moving farther
away or crossing past the bound is rejected. The buffered target is explicitly
the pre-clamp demand-plus-buffer value; its field bound includes the maximum
legal demand and ratio buffer, while `desired_replicas` remains the actuated
step target.

`ScalingDecisionLog` is the backend-neutral append/get/list contract. The
in-memory implementation is a bounded, thread-safe reference backend only.
`PostgresScalingDecisionLog` is the shared production backend: an environment
uses an explicit store ID, and that store durably fixes its capacity so two
controllers cannot silently apply different bounds. A row lock on the registry
serializes capacity checks, per-model mutation-generation allocation, and
inserts. The primary key provides exactly-once decision IDs; reads revalidate
both the JSON payload and its duplicated indexed metadata/fingerprint before
returning it. Replaying either the original unallocated draft or the returned
allocated record resolves to the same durable record. Optional WP3.4/WP3.5
fields are omitted from the canonical fingerprint when absent, preserving the
fingerprint and readability of older schema-v1 rows.

PostgreSQL objects live in the explicitly qualified `public` schema. Startup
fails closed unless ordered columns, nullability, primary/foreign/check
constraints, the model/time lookup index (including sort direction), permanent
table persistence, and schema version all match. The namespace OID is pinned
and rechecked after reconnect. The schema is append-only through the public API;
retention/export policy is deliberately deferred until evidence establishes an
operational horizon.

## Kubernetes scale actuation and next integration boundary

WP3.3 consumes a validated decision record and applies its bounded desired
replica count through the Deployment or StatefulSet `scale` subresource. The
actuator reads the live `Scale`, skips exact retries and hold decisions, and
uses its `resourceVersion` for a single idempotent write. Conflicts and malformed
responses fail closed. WP3.4 adds the production ordering contract: callers
enter through `mutate_autoscaler()`, persist the returned authority with
`claim_authority()` before observing decision inputs, append the decision to
obtain its durable generation, and call `apply_fenced()`. The parent workload
JSON Patch tests resourceVersion, UID, workload generation, claimed authority,
and live replicas while atomically changing replicas and recording decision
generation, ID, and canonical fingerprint. Exact retries require the entire
decision identity; later generations may supersede unapplied decisions but
cannot move backwards. Stale leaders, reused generations, changed release
or model revision, and malformed responses fail closed. The actuator also
resolves the supplied decision by ID from its configured durable log and
requires the complete fingerprint, so a caller-created generation is not an
actuation capability. Parent workload PATCH is broader than scale-subresource
RBAC, so deployment must use a dedicated service account and constrain the
permitted workload/fields with admission policy.
The legacy `apply()` scale-subresource primitive is disabled by default and can
only be enabled explicitly for isolated verification; the production runtime
must use `apply_fenced()`.

## Quota and Kueue admission fence

WP3.5 keeps quota allocation in the component that owns the complete tenant and
cluster view. Kairyu does not duplicate Kueue cohort borrowing, lending, fair
sharing, or preemption. `parse_kueue_scaling_admission()` instead converts one
Kueue Workload v1beta1/v1beta2 response into an immutable admission identity:
namespace/name/UID/generation/resourceVersion, LocalQueue, ClusterQueue,
pod-set name/count, ResourceFlavor, GPU resource quantity, and full workload
priority-class identity. Four required `kairyu.ai/scale-target-{kind,namespace,
name,uid}` Workload annotations bind that reservation to exactly one Deployment
or StatefulSet; the binding must equal the decision target revision before a
write. The Workload's immutable `metadata.name` must additionally equal
`kairyu-scale-<sha256(kind NUL namespace NUL name NUL uid)>`; changing only the
annotations therefore cannot rebind an admitted reservation during a later
decision, and a recreated target UID requires a new Workload. The admitted pod
count and GPU quantity must match the target's immutable
GPUs-per-replica shape. An inactive Workload, absent
`Admitted=True` condition, or absent admission assignment produces a
zero-capacity result. Ambiguous pod-set assignments, fractional GPU quantities,
unsupported API versions, incomplete identity, or an `Admitted=True` condition
whose `observedGeneration` does not equal the Workload generation fail closed.
Kueue priority uses its native ordering where the higher integer has precedence.

`ScalingQuotaSnapshot` combines that exact Kueue admission with three canonical
nested budgets: cluster, model family, and tenant/model. Each budget records its
hard GPU limit, usage excluding the target, and capacity reserved for
higher-priority workloads. `target_reserved_gpus` is not an advisory local
counter: it must equal the GPU quantity atomically admitted for the target
Kueue Workload and fit the available capacity of every nested budget. Cluster,
model-family, and tenant/model limits must therefore be projections of the same
Kueue-owned reservation, with the deployment's ClusterQueue/cohort hierarchy
encoding those budgets. They must never be produced by independent read/check
logic. This makes Kueue the serialization point for simultaneous scale-ups of
different models; Kairyu only derives independently auditable total replica
ceilings from that reservation after dividing by the immutable GPUs-per-replica
value.

`admit_scaling_quota()` clamps a requested scale-up to the minimum cluster,
family, tenant/model, and Kueue ceiling. It never converts exhausted quota into
a scale-down: capacity below the live replica count yields HOLD. Every limiting
scope is persisted in `ScalingQuotaAdmission`; a constrained decision must use
the `budget_limit` reason unless stale-observation safety takes precedence,
while an unconstrained decision cannot claim a budget limit. The decision
validator binds the quota snapshot ID/revision and
tenant/model capacity evidence to the observed current replicas, policy
max/step, model class, and freshness window. `apply_fenced()` refuses a
production scale-up without this durable admission and requires a fresh quota
reauthorization immediately before PATCH. The refreshed nested limits must
still admit the desired count and the Kueue Workload, queue, flavor, resource,
and priority identity must be unchanged. Its observation timestamp is checked
again against the just-refreshed leader authority and the policy freshness
window, so replaying an unchanged but old admission cannot authorize a delayed
PATCH. Quota revisions may advance but cannot roll back. Revocation,
reassignment, a target-binding change, stale observation, revision rollback, or
a lower ceiling fails closed. The decision fingerprint prevents replacing the
original evidence after append.

Kueue CRD installation, ClusterQueue/LocalQueue/ResourceFlavor definitions,
the global reservation snapshot producer, and RBAC belong to deployment wiring
in private-ai-cloud-iac. Durable Runner-status storage remains separate wiring.

## Cache-aware staged scale-out

WP3.6 makes cache locality an explicit, fail-closed scale-out input instead of
letting a newly created Runner discover a cold model after scheduling. A
`ScalingPrewarmSnapshot` identifies one immutable model class, model revision,
artifact digest, and deployment-owned placement binding plus a monotonic cache revision. Its canonical placement
inventory records node and ResourceFlavor, an approved hardware profile and
compatibility record, assignment/health/schedulability gates, and one of
`absent`, `filling`, `ready`, or `failed`. Placements are replica-sized units;
an implementation may publish multiple units for a node only when that
capacity is independently schedulable.

`plan_cache_aware_scale_up()` receives the final quota-admitted target and its
Kueue ResourceFlavor. It selects only unassigned, healthy, schedulable
placements of that flavor, then deterministically splits the delta into:

1. ready placements that may start Runners immediately;
2. filling placements that remain pending;
3. absent placements that require cache-fill commands; and
4. unplanned replicas for which no eligible placement exists.

The returned `ScalingPrewarmPlan` persists all four outcomes in the append-only
decision. The quota target remains the eventual capacity goal while
`runner_target_replicas` is the only immediately actuated count. A plan with no
ready placement produces a `cache_prewarm` HOLD rather than a cold Runner; a
mixed plan can start ready capacity while retaining its remaining cache-fill
intent. In WP3.6 those placement IDs are durable desired-work evidence, not an
executable cache-agent command. A production consumer must not dispatch them
directly from a HOLD record. WP4.7 now converts them into commands carrying a
leader/target/artifact fence and monotonic generation, then uses placement-level
claim/CAS, idempotent replay, verified fill/pin, and a completion record. It
publishes a later monotonic snapshot as placements move through `filling` to `ready`, and
reconciliation creates a new scaling decision rather than editing the earlier
record. This boundary prevents a stale HOLD decision from becoming an
unfenced cache mutation before the cache-agent protocol exists.

Cache locality never overrides health, schedulability, the explicit hardware
compatibility approval, or Kueue quota. The decision validator binds the plan's
model class, model revision, current replica count, final quota target, and
ResourceFlavor to the observation, target revision, and Kueue admission. It
also includes the cache observation timestamp in the conservative freshness
calculation. Startup phase EMA and p95 evidence remains in the same durable
observation window, so the post-deployment 0→50 acceptance run can correlate
each cache stage with image pull, model fetch, model load, compile, and warmup
without reconstructing inputs from mutable telemetry.

Production scale-up additionally requires `reauthorize_prewarm()` immediately
before the Kubernetes JSON Patch, after leader and quota reauthorization. The
refreshed inventory may advance in time and revision, but cannot roll back or
change model/artifact/flavor/target identity. Every placement that justified
the durable Runner delta must still be ready and eligible, and the refreshed
plan must retain enough ready capacity for that delta. Staleness, eviction,
failure, reassignment, artifact change, or capacity loss aborts before the
workload mutation. The final refreshed quota target and prewarm target must
still be identical; retaining only enough quota for the immediate partial
scale cannot leave a larger cache-fill intent authorized. The parent workload
must also carry `kairyu.ai/cache-placement-binding` equal to the plan's binding
ID. The actuator tests that annotation in the atomic JSON Patch and requires it
unchanged in the response. The deployment scheduler/admission integration owns
that binding and must constrain new Pods to the selected cache topology; a
missing or mismatched binding fails before scale-out. Its concrete scheduler,
DaemonSet, PVC/local-storage, affinity, RBAC, Kueue, and binding wiring belongs
to private-ai-cloud-iac and is a deployment gate before enabling production
autoscaling. D3.1-D3.4 now provide the library-side exact binding, atomic
scale-from-zero Pod-template constraint, inherited-binding observation, and
Runner-owned full-digest startup proof, plus a linearizable CREATE-admission
claim contract that maps each incremental Pod name to one exact placement and
injects its node affinity before persistence. Cache-bound Runners remain `WARMING`
and routing-ineligible until the proof matches the actual Pod UID/node and every
bound decision/artifact/generation identity. The highly available webhook and
shared claim-store deployment remain external wiring; changing a shared
template while replicas exist remains prohibited because it could roll existing
Pods.

WP4.4 now supplies the library-side producer for this input. A node publishes a
short-lived, verified-only, path-free hint from its WP4.3 index, and
`build_cache_placement_snapshot()` joins exact digest/revision matches to the
controller-owned placement inventory. Missing, expired, future, or non-exact
hints remain `absent`; cache locality does not alter health, schedulability,
assignment, ResourceFlavor, profile, or compatibility facts. The transport,
durable global revision CAS, and scheduler binding remain the deployment gate
described above. See `docs/design/node-model-cache-placement-hints-v1.md`.

## Drain-authorized deterministic scale-down

WP3.7 connects the WP2.4 drain proof to the production scaling actuator without
letting a replica-count write choose an unverified victim. Each candidate first
stops queue intake and leaves routing through `ReplicaPoolDrainController`, then
records authoritative post-fence `active_requests=0` evidence and an exact
`RunnerTerminationAuthorization`. Before authorization, deployment-side drain
integration must install the `kairyu.ai/scale-down-drain` Pod finalizer and RBAC
must reserve removal of that deletion hold to the leader-fenced scale actuator;
that installer remains part of the deferred runtime wiring. A
`ScalingDrainSnapshot` binds those immutable
Runner and Pod identities to one StatefulSet UID, generation, release, model
revision, and monotonic drain revision. `plan_statefulset_scale_down()` selects
exactly the ordinal interval `[desired_replicas, current_replicas)`, which is the
highest-ordinal suffix removed by an ordinary StatefulSet replica reduction.
Missing authorization for any selected ordinal fails closed. This version
supports the standard zero start ordinal only; a StatefulSet configured with a
non-zero `spec.ordinals.start` is rejected until that offset is part of the
durable plan contract.

The append-only scale decision persists that complete `ScalingDrainPlan`; its
fingerprint, oldest selected Runner observation time, current count, desired
count, and target revision are validated with the other decision inputs. A new
outer snapshot timestamp therefore cannot launder stale `active_requests=0`
evidence. Immediately before mutation, `reauthorize_drain()` must return a
fresh, non-rollback snapshot with the same target and exact candidate Runner,
Pod, ordinal, and termination-authorization evidence. The actuator then reads
each selected Pod and verifies its UID, StatefulSet owner, deletion hold, and
non-deleting state. The finalizer prevents that exact Pod from disappearing and
being replaced between this check and the parent replica-count patch.

After the parent StatefulSet PATCH commits, Kairyu issues DELETE for every
selected Pod with a UID precondition and removes only its own finalizer through
a UID/finalizer JSON Patch. Finalizers are released one ordinal at a time from
highest to lowest. A lower ordinal remains held until every higher selected Pod
is absent. The actuator waits up to 30 seconds for each zero-grace deletion; a
timeout returns an explicit cleanup-pending error, and the standard controller
retry resumes the same durable decision. This lets the StatefulSet controller
preserve ordered termination while completing the already-authorized removal
without a replacement-UID race.
Existing decision annotations and parent resourceVersion/generation tests retain
concurrent-write behavior. If the actuator crashes after committing the parent
scale but before releasing every Pod, an exact retry uses the durable plan to
release only surviving held UIDs; already absent ordinals are read-only no-ops.
If leadership changes in that interval, a successor with the same election ID
and a strictly newer fencing token may perform only this cleanup after proving
the exact decision fingerprint, applied generation, and desired count on the
parent; it cannot reuse the old decision for another parent mutation.
The watcher/reconciler later observes each Pod disappearance and records the
corresponding terminal Runner state.

Deployment scale-down remains disabled in the fenced production path. A
Deployment replica decrease permits its controller to choose victims, while
pod-deletion-cost and similar hints do not provide the exact deletion guarantee
required by a drain authorization. Supporting Deployment shrink therefore
requires a future targeted-eviction adapter with equivalent identity, fencing,
and idempotency semantics. Kubernetes runtime wiring, durable status inventory,
and the live drain/scale acceptance run remain deployment gates and are deferred
to the consolidated Phase 3 environment verification.
