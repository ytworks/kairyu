# Checklist-Verified Answers (DeepSeek-V4.1 six-GPU + OpenJev x 2)

Status: **Accepted 2026-10-01; redesigned 2026-10-02 (VCO-D15), GPU gates
being re-run** (evidence: `examples/deepseek-v4.1-openjev-verified-8gpu/MEASUREMENTS.md`).
Applies to: `examples/deepseek-v4.1-openjev-verified-8gpu/`. Framework
mechanisms: m1 D8 (checklist verifiers) and the m11 D8 replica amendment.

## Goal

Return an answer with a guarantee flag that means "the request was met":
every requirement of a checklist that is necessary, sufficient and mutually
exclusive (MECE) with respect to the request passed. Otherwise return the
best available answer with the flag off and the reason.

Roles (owner, 2026-10-01):

- DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, one DP6/EP6 replica on GPUs 0-5 (the six-GPU
  example's L1): requirement extraction, generator, state builder, repair.
- OpenJev (DiffusionGemma 26B-A4B), one replica each on GPU 6 and GPU 7,
  read through System One: requirement confirmation and per-requirement
  judgments.
- Kairyu L2: Validator, Conductor, transitions, fallback.

## Decisions

### VCO-D1 — DAG

`verified.yaml` (DSL only; no Python orchestration in the example):

1. Wave 1: `extract` (DeepSeek, thinking high, JSON grammar) and
   `generator` (DeepSeek, caller effort, sees only the conversation; a caller
   `response_format` constrains it) run in parallel. `extract` is verified by
   `requirements_check` inline (VCO-D2).
2. Wave 2: `answer` is seeded with the generator's draft (no model call) and
   verified by `checklist`: Validator checks, then `state_builder` (DeepSeek,
   non-thinking, JSON claims with verbatim evidence) re-run on the attempt,
   then OpenJev reads, then the Conductor rule. A FAIL is repaired by
   DeepSeek through `answer.refine_prompt` with the failing items, at most
   twice, and the Validator runs again on the repaired version.
3. A rules router with `multi_step_markers: 0` sends every request to the
   DAG: short requests are not exempt from the guarantee.

### VCO-D2 — Requirement set
*Superseded by VCO-D15 (2026-10-02): no rule-based check judges an answer.*


The extractor splits the request (system/developer instructions and the
latest user message) into instruction units U1..Un and writes conditions
R1..Rm, each with a proposition, a kind (`deterministic` with one primitive
from the shared check library, or `semantic`), and its source units.
Identifiers and labels are not instructions; an action that cannot be
performed here becomes "states that it cannot be performed".

`requirements_check` confirms it:

- **Sufficiency**: deterministic coverage (every unit id is cited) and one
  `noul` read per unit ("an answer meeting the conditions citing Ui meets
  Ui"), threshold 0.5.
- **Necessity**: one read per condition ("its source units ask for it").
  Threshold 0 for the verdict; curation drops conditions with p < 0.5.
- **Exclusivity**: one read per pair of conditions sharing a source unit
  ("they require the same thing", expect no), threshold 0.5.

A coverage gap or a duplicate re-extracts once with the problems listed.
Afterwards curation drops low-necessity conditions, merges remaining likely
duplicates (first kept, sources united, propositions joined) and pads every
uncovered unit with "the answer responds to this part of the request: <unit>".

Request-independent requirements have their own ids and never overlap the
extracted ones: G1 groundedness (material-based claims quote the material
verbatim — `G1-excerpts`, deterministic — and, advisory only since
VCO-D11, every claim is supported — OpenJev per claim kind, minimum), G2
execution claims (an "action" claim's
evidence must appear in the conversation, i.e. its tool call and result),
G3 quotations in the answer appear in the conversation.

### VCO-D3 — Validator and Conductor
*Superseded by VCO-D15 (2026-10-02): no rule-based check judges an answer.*


The Validator is the deterministic half of `checklist`: extracted
`deterministic` conditions (an unusable primitive falls back to an OpenJev
read of the proposition), G3 before the state builder, G1-excerpts and G2
after it. Any violation goes to repair without an OpenJev read. The Conductor
passes an attempt only when every item has p >= tau_hi (a check is 1 or 0);
the advisory per-claim G1 items (VCO-D11) are reported but do not gate.
Because the checklist was confirmed sufficient, every item passing means the
request was met.

### VCO-D4 — tau_hi (amended: alpha = 0.10)

tau_hi is calibrated on InFoBench's expert annotation (50 instructions x 5
models, 1,129 labelled requirement judgments). Each decomposed question is
rewritten by DeepSeek as a condition statement and judged through the
production checklist code (same state and question conversion). tau_hi is
the smallest threshold whose accepted judgments have a one-sided 95 %
Clopper-Pearson upper bound on the violation rate <= alpha on the
calibration half (split by instruction, seed 20261001). The held-out half is
reported unchanged (`calibrate.py`).

Result: tau_hi = 0.9966. Calibration: 392 accepted, 29 violations, upper
bound 0.0995. Held-out: 398 accepted, 25 violations (6.3 %), upper bound
0.0866. 54 of 125 held-out answers pass every requirement; 10 of them carry
at least one labelled violation.

Why alpha = 0.10, not 0.05 (owner decision, 2026-10-01): the labels are
noisier than 0.05. When one expert annotator says a requirement is
satisfied, the official label says violated 9.1 % / 10.0 % of the time (the
two experts disagree 5.9-6.6 % of the time). At alpha = 0.05 only p = 1.0
exactly qualified (about 10 % of requirements). Request-form variants did
not lower the violation rate: smaller states, one question per read,
stricter criteria, `steps`/`samples`, atomized requirements, and `think`
all scored equal or worse AUROC (MEASUREMENTS.md).

Limitation: InFoBench has no source material, so G1 was not covered by this
calibration; VCO-D11 measured it separately and made it advisory.

### VCO-D5 — Fallback

- Repair limit: the newest attempt whose deterministic checks passed (else
  the draft), `guaranteed: false`, `reason: refinement_limit`.
- Judge unavailable (both OpenJev replicas down or overloaded, in either
  verifier): the generator's draft as-is, `reason: judge_unavailable`.
- Checklist not judgeable (no parseable list, state above 160,000 characters
  for OpenJev's 65,536-token window): the draft, `reason:
  checklist_unavailable`.

### VCO-D6 — Output

The chat response carries `kairyu_verification` (m1 D8) next to the answer;
the answer text is never altered. The example's answer page (nginx on
:3013, Kairyu's API on the same origin) shows the badge, the reason, and the
requirement table with each p.

### VCO-D7 — Jev routing and the think route (2026-10-01)

Two public models: `kairyu-verified` lets Jev (m1 D9) choose between the
verified DAG (VERIFIED) and `deepseek_think`, one thinking DeepSeek answer
(THINK); `kairyu-verified-always` keeps every request on the verified DAG and
backs the answer page and the guarantee gates. VERIFIED criteria: difficult
or specialised questions, many requirements, earlier answers corrected,
a frustrated or pressured user, high-stakes domains, explicit demands for
correctness or sources, output that will be published, sent, signed or
executed, and long multi-part deliverables. Owner decision: accuracy first
(`prefer: VERIFIED` at tau_route; missed accuracy-critical requests < 10 %).
An unjudgeable route falls back to `deepseek_think`, since the verified DAG
could not be judged either. The publisher's private reasoning is withheld
by Kairyu's multi-stage contract on both routes.

### VCO-D8 — Implicit requirements (2026-10-01)

The extractor adds conditions the situation clearly presupposes (origin
`implicit`, attached to the units they serve) next to the stated ones. Each
implicit condition gets its own necessity read ("does the user expect this
even though they did not say it?") and curation drops it below 0.5, so it
enters the guarantee only when Jev judges it expected. Coverage and
exclusivity checks apply unchanged; sufficiency stays on the stated units.

Amendment (2026-10-02): the first full `implicit` gate failed (recall 0.525,
controls kept 0.8 implicit conditions each): the extractor, prompted with
"answering in the user's language" as an example, added that default to
every request (Jev rates it necessary at p 1.0) and missed situational
ones. The extractor now walks the situation (given material to keep, the
audience, the medium's limits, real-world circumstances, produced
artifacts) and leaves out what any ordinary reply meets by default. On a
separate dev set written before the change (12 + 4 controls): recall 0.875
-> 0.917, controls 0.75 -> 0.00. The next gate run reached controls 0.0
but recall 0.600 while extraction plus Jev alone reached 0.825 on the same
set: re-extraction (after a coverage gap or duplicate) rewrote the list
without the implicit guidance and dropped the implicit conditions. The
refine prompt now keeps every implicit condition the problems do not name
and carries the same guidance. The gate's coverage judge now thinks: in
chat mode it marked "every price is kept" uncovered next to three
conditions keeping each price (thinking judge 0.900 vs 0.825 on the same
lists).

Amendment 2 (2026-10-02, owner decision): extraction is two-stage. With
both kinds in one prompt the extractor wrote fewer stated conditions (4.5
vs 5.1 per InFoBench request) and InFoBench gold recall fell to 0.867. Now
`extract` lists stated conditions only (origin `explicit`), and a separate
`implicit` role, in parallel with it (no dependency, so no added latency),
lists at most four situational conditions with the request words they
belong to; `implicit_check` asks Jev per condition and curation drops it
below 0.5 without blocking the guarantee. The final checklist reads both.
Extraction plus Jev, measured without the full DAG: implicit-set recall
0.925-0.950, dev set 1.000, controls 0.0-0.4 (the planets question listed
the correct answer's content; that is now excluded).

### VCO-D9 — One effort for every DeepSeek step (2026-10-01)

Owner requirement: whatever the route, every DeepSeek role (extract,
generator, repair, state builder, think answer) runs at the caller's
`reasoning_effort` (API field or the Open WebUI dropdown), default high
(75). Open WebUI offers both models and shows the guarantee in the folded
"Verification" section.

### VCO-D10 — Review amendment (PR #616, 2026-10-01)

A requirement checklist still failing sufficiency after re-extraction and
curation blocks the guarantee (`requirements_unconfirmed`); deterministic
conditions are never merged; execution claims need tool-result evidence;
`n > 1` is refused on the verified models.

### VCO-D11 — Per-claim G1 is advisory (2026-10-02)
*Superseded by VCO-D15 (2026-10-02): no rule-based check judges an answer.*


Owner request: calibrate G1 on its own, per claim kind, at alpha = 0.10
(95 %, answer level). `calibrate_g1.py` ran the production state builder
(high effort) and the production G1 questions on 600 human-labelled answers
per kind, split by problem / document / page: RAGTruth for source and
action claims (any hallucination span), PRM800K phase 2 for computation (a
-1 step; 300 + 300 balanced), FEVER for general knowledge (REFUTES).

| Kind | AUROC | accepted at p >= 0.99 | violated |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| G1-source (RAGTruth) | 0.694 | 157 | 37 (23.6 %) |
| G1-computation (PRM800K) | 0.704 | 185 | 74 (40.0 %) |
| G1-general (FEVER) | 0.893 | 251 | 38 (15.1 %) |

No threshold reaches alpha on source and computation; general reaches it on
the calibration half (tau 0.99926, 89 accepted, 4 violated) but not on the
held-out half (99 accepted, 15 violated, upper bound 0.224). Causes seen in
the data: RAGTruth counts true but unsourced additions as hallucinations
while G1 accepts well-established knowledge; OpenJev does not detect
arithmetic and reasoning errors; OpenJev is confident on false facts.

Owner decision (option A): the per-claim G1 questions stay, split by kind,
with threshold 0 and tag `guarantee: advisory` (since VCO-D12 only
G1-source remains). Their p is reported in
`kairyu_verification`, the Verification section and the answer page, but
they neither repair nor block the guarantee. The guarantee covers the
calibrated requirements (tau_hi) and the deterministic G1-excerpts, G2 and
G3. Also observed: 12 of 1,800 state-builder outputs were truncated JSON
(runaway newlines), which serving reports as `checklist_unavailable`.

### VCO-D12 — Latency target and the slimmer state builder (2026-10-02)
*Superseded by VCO-D15 (2026-10-02): no rule-based check judges an answer.*


Owner target: p50 <= 3 minutes on long InFoBench requests (every DeepSeek
step keeps the caller's effort, repairs stay at most two). Traced breakdown
(8 InFoBench requests, c8): the state builder took 92 s and 10,491 output
tokens per attempt, listing every claim although only source and action
claims feed a guarantee (G1-excerpts, G2); computation and general claims fed
only advisory, uncalibrated questions (VCO-D11). It now lists source and
action claims only; G1-computation and G1-general are gone. The step budget
(16) was below the two-stage worst case (18) and published answers
unverified (`reason: budget`); it is 24. Result: p50 492 s -> 297 s, state
builder 44 s / 5,109 tokens, guaranteed 1/8 -> 3/8. The floor is extraction
(implicit 110 s in parallel with extract 89 s) plus one attempt (answer and
state builder, about 70 s); repairs add about 70 s each.

### VCO-D13 — Instruction units read within the caller's format (2026-10-02)
*Superseded by VCO-D15 (2026-10-02): no rule-based check judges an answer.*


The structured gate's "Pick a European capital and describe it in exactly
the requested JSON" (fields city, country, population_estimate) was not
guaranteed: OpenJev read "describe it" as free prose, called the field
conditions unrequested (necessity p 0.005-0.02) and three fields an
incomplete description (sufficiency 0.01). Owner ruling: under a fixed
format, "describe it" means filling those fields; the answer deserves the
guarantee, and the fix belongs in how the requirement reaches Jev. The
extractor now appends to each unit that asks for content the format bounds
the scope to read it in ("describe it (the caller fixed the answer to a JSON
object with only the fields city, country and population_estimate; this is
done by filling them)"). Probes (5 reads each): all fields covered ->
sufficiency 0.85-0.93; population condition missing -> 0.11-0.18 (still
rejected); free-text requests unchanged. A shorter scope ("within the
caller's fixed JSON fields") did not work (0.03-0.07). Structured gate: two
runs, 4/4 guaranteed.

Amendment (2026-10-02, owner option A): six in-process runs per request
(live L1 / OpenJev, every exchange logged) showed three further causes.
(1) A grammar-constrained draft can degenerate (an integer repeating zeros
to max_tokens); repairing that 93,582-character draft thought to max_tokens
and returned nothing (3/3). The repair prompt now rewrites a cut-off or
degenerate draft from the conversation (3/3 valid). (2) An implicit
condition picked one reading the request leaves open ("a city proper, not
its metropolitan area"), so repair rewrote a correct Tokyo population; the
implicit extractor now lists only what every reasonable reading shares
(Japan request 3/4 -> 6/6 guaranteed). (3) Re-extraction dropped the format
scope; the refine prompt keeps it. Known limit: OpenJev's reading of
"describe it" against three fixed fields still swings with the
extractor's wording (necessity and sufficiency 0.02-0.98), so the European
capital request is guaranteed in 2-5 of 6 runs; a separate format unit and
three-sample reads did not steady it. Also seen once: the state builder
listed a JSON field as an "action" claim, failing G2.


Defect found by the requirements gate (2026-10-02): on a puzzle request
("a 9-digit lockscreen pattern ..."), the implicit extractor tried to solve
the puzzle, thought until max_tokens (32,768) and returned cut-off JSON; the
final checklist could not read it and the whole answer ended
`checklist_unavailable` (1 of 4 reruns). Both extractors are now told never
to work out the answer itself, and implicit_check writes a broken list once
more (max_refinements 1; worst case 20 steps, budget 24).

### VCO-D14 — The caller's tools reach the published draft (2026-10-02, issue #617)

DeepSWE (mini-swe-agent, `tools=[bash]`) got HTTP 200 answers whose tool
calls were plain text (`<invoke name="bash">`, `Tool: bash`), so the agent
executed nothing; two turns ended HTTP 502 `EmptyFinalOutput`. Cause: only
the final unit (`answer`) carried the caller's tools, but its attempt 0 is the
generator's draft, which was generated without them; and `latest_checks_passed`
published an empty last repair over a non-empty draft. Fix (m1 D8
amendment): the seed of a seeded final unit is generated under the caller's
tool contract, and exhaustion never chooses an empty attempt when a non-empty
one exists. The repair prompt now tells DeepSeek to emit a tool call through
the tool interface, never as text.

Review amendment (PR #618): an empty repair that passes every item vacuously
is not accepted, so the draft is published as `refinement_limit`. The same
GPU rerun showed every later agent turn (about 42K-token conversations)
falling back to deepseek_think: the route judge's state exceeded OpenJev's
65,536-token context (HTTP 400). The judge now reads at most 120,000
characters of conversation (`max_conversation_chars`, m1 D9 amendment): the
first message plus the newest that fit; a 111-message DeepSWE conversation
bounded this way is 37,716 OpenJev tokens.

Second GPU rerun (5376ec73): no judge 400s, every response a structured tool
call, but long turns on the verified route ended `checklist_unavailable`:
their conversation state was 526,443-651,415 characters against
`max_state_chars: 160000`. Every checklist's conversation section now sets
`max_total_chars: 100000`, leaving 60,000 characters for the other sections.

### VCO-D15 — Points, adoption and coverage, all read by models (2026-10-02, PR #618)

Owner decision. The guarantee was LLM-based to overcome the limits of rules,
yet the Validator added rule-based checks (G1-excerpts, G2, G3, extracted
`deterministic` conditions, S0/S1 coverage). These were not requirements of
any request, and on agent turns G3 misread tool-call JSON as quotations: all
ten verified DeepSWE turns failed it, no OpenJev read ran, and two repairs
were wasted per turn (305-554 s). Every rule-based check is removed from the
example and from the framework (m1 D8 amendment).

The goal is unchanged: the answer meets a requirement set that is MECE with
respect to the request.

1. **Points (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive).** `extract`
   (explicit) and `implicit` (presupposed) run in parallel. Each writes a
   list of points, one per issue, that together cover the request. The
   requirements gate measures coverage of InFoBench's gold questions and
   duplicate pairs.
2. **Adoption (necessary).** One Jev request asks, for every point of both
   lists, "is this point necessary to answer the request?". The state is the
   request verbatim (system/developer messages plus the latest user message)
   and `history`, a non-thinking DeepSeek summary of every other message
   (earlier turns, tool calls and tool results). Summarizing these instead of
   passing them verbatim keeps the read inside OpenJev's 65,536 tokens.
   Points with p < 0.5 leave their list. `history` waits for both extractors
   so that `adopt`, its verifier, reads both lists in one request.
3. **Coverage.** One Jev request asks, for every adopted point, "does the
   answer contain this point?". The state is the answer exactly as it will be
   sent. Every p >= tau_hi gives the guarantee. A miss is repaired by DeepSeek
   at most twice; otherwise the last non-empty answer is returned as
   `refinement_limit`.
4. **Agent turns.** A request with `tools` is answered by one assistant
   message, which may hold several tool calls. The extractors read the tool
   definitions (`{tools}`) and list what this one message must do now, never
   the completion of the task.

tau_hi is recalibrated on InFoBench for the coverage question and its state
(`calibrate.py`); the per-claim G1 calibration (`calibrate_g1.py`) is removed
with G1.

## Limitations

- A guaranteed answer is not streamed before its checklist finishes (time to
  first token is the whole pipeline).
- The routing set is author-labelled with clear-cut categories; borderline
  requests are not measured by it.
- The 0.5 necessity cut of the adoption read is a default, not calibrated.
- The guarantee covers the adopted points, not the truth of every claim in
  the answer.
- An extractor cut off before its JSON closes leaves its list unreadable and
  the answer unverified (`checklist_unavailable`); there is no rewrite.
- With tools, each assistant message is judged on its own points; whether
  the whole agent run solves the task is not part of the flag.
