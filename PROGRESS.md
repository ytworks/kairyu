## Product

**Goal** (master roadmap `docs/roadmap.md`, accepted 2026-07-03): serve a
Fugu-class orchestration product — multi-model auto-routing plus agent
ensemble/synthesis behind one OpenAI-compatible API and a chat UI — from an
on-prem DC of thousands of GPUs across **two first-class hardware profiles**:
NVLink-HBM nodes (8× H100-class, TP-first) and PCIe-GDDR nodes (RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell, DP-first / PP for capacity / EP over RDMA). TTFT/TPOT/goodput must
beat frontier APIs as measured by the committed harness (G6 gate P-C1).

- L1 stays Kairyu's own engine (kernel libraries like FlashInfer are used;
  scheduler, radix KV, spec decode, orchestration are ours). Layering:
  L3 Interface / L2 Orchestration / L1 Engines.
- Target model classes: small dense ~14B (latency tier), mid dense ~70B,
  mid MoE 100–300B, frontier MoE 500B+ (multi-node EP).
- Parallelism/quantization strategy is derived per measured hardware profile,
  never assumed. Details: `docs/goals/g2..g6-*.md`.

## Current Status

Snapshot date: 2026-08-17. Hardware context: all GPU evidence so far is on
8× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (SM120), PCIe-only interconnect (P2P 30–37 GB/s);
NVLink-HBM (H100-class) formal gates still need hardware. Evidence lives in
`bench/results/` (see `index.json`); decisions and rationale in `docs/design/`.

### Formal gates

- G2 A1: complete — TP1/2 logprob-agreement closure on Llama-3.1-8B
- G2 A2: complete — TP2/4/8 closure on Llama-3.3-70B FP8-dynamic
- G2 A6 (perf vs vLLM): **open** — TP4 ShareGPT 0.466× SLO-goodput HTTP; matrix deferred while gap closes
- G2 A7: closed — >80% KV cache-hit rates on Qwen3-32B TP4/TP8, direct and gateway
- G2 A8 (DP scaling): `passed: false` (1.7993× vs 1.9× threshold); owner accepted as explicit closure deviation
- G2 A9: closed — DP=2×TP4 vs TP8 production-topology report on Qwen3-32B
- A12 (batch-invariance determinism, #360): closed — exact-match verdict passed on Qwen3-32B TP8
- #356 real-checkpoint quant parity: evidence complete — INT8 PASS; AWQ/GPTQ formal FAIL retained with SHA-bound same-GPU oracle replay isolating checkpoint quantization loss
- B7 (KV answer-equivalence, #373): operator implemented and portable-validated; additive over F2/F4
- G4 MoE: M-A1 formal FAIL retained; M-A2 complete; M-A3 scope-closed by owner deviation (perf gate stays FAIL); dense BF16 MoE uses sort-by-expert grouped GEMM and fixed-capacity EP transport, then combines returned rows in fixed FP32 order before one model-dtype cast
- G4 E-KV: unit-scale and calibrated per-layer K/V FP8-E4M3 re-bakes **FAIL** retained; calibrated cache metrics/logprobs pass but 16K/32K exact tokens and decode envelope do not; `fp8_e4m3` startup rejected
- G5: F1a–F1d, F2a–F2d, F4a, F4b all closed; F4c decided (keep per-replica RadixKV + F2 routing, thresholded revisit)
- F5a/b/c (priority, noisy-neighbor, SLO admission): closed
- G6: P-A, P-B1–P-B4, P-C2/C3/C4 green (incl. Open WebUI P-B3 browser gate); remaining P-C gates continue
- #150 TP8 long-generation stability gate: passed after deadlock fix; #364 `logits_dtype`: valid negative, withdrawn

### What works today

- `kairyu serve --tp N` on real hardware: Qwen3-32B TP8, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.3-70B FP8, Qwen3-VL-32B (via vLLM replica)
- Attention backends: `auto`/torch/FlashInfer/FA3/FA4 with `/backends` reporting; capable CUDA models pre-capture decode graphs before readiness
- Quantized serving: FP8/INT8/AWQ/GPTQ/NVFP4 without full dequantization; opt-in FP8 EAGLE/MTP draft loading
- Incremental architecture-state paths for Qwen3.6 and DeepSeek V4 plus an explicit recompute diagnostic mode; DeepSeek EP2/4/8 Attention-DP and direct packed-FP4 execution are implemented, with SM120 single-kernel and two-rank NCCL smokes green
- Device-side sampling, penalties, spec verification, page-table caching; TP step headers sleep on Gloo while fixed-layout delta payloads use the bounded NCCL model group and rare controls remain Gloo objects; structured masks stay on CUDA with only selected IDs returned to the host matcher; deterministic n-gram/EAGLE-3/MTP drafts preserve T>0 and penalized sampling
- Hardened gateway: auth, tenancy metering/invoicing, priority + SLO admission, batch API, embeddings/RAG, Responses API
- Orchestration (Conductor/MoA) with streaming, usage accounting, trace v2; assistant history round-trips typed `reasoning_content` while assistant-only LiteLLM provider objects and nullable legacy function calls are ignored before rendering and other extras remain fail-closed; MoA keeps the original response contract distinct from untrusted candidate drafts, with configured completion delimiters and the multi-stage boundary withholding private synthesis reasoning; prefix-aware replica placement obeys the configured queue-depth overload valve; Codex CLI and IDE tool-calling work end-to-end, including AUTO models over /v1/responses (#530)
- Fleet: 3-gateway HA with PostgreSQL BatchStore, KV-aware prefix routing, DRAM KV tiering, Helm chart + kind CI drill
- Checkout-only eval tooling retains explicit Core, Quantization, Structured Output, and Long Context suites with hash-chained quality history, config A/B comparisons, and quantization sweeps; Kairyu correctness and performance gates are owned by `verification/`, not evals
- The tiered RTX PRO example (DTO-D13, 2026-08-22) puts a bounded Qwen non-thinking route judge in front of five profiles — four single-call direct routes (Qwen non-thinking, Qwen thinking-medium, DeepSeek non-thinking on the re-added `tier2-direct` pool, DeepSeek thinking at the L3 effort; official per-mode sampling fixed on the final unit, vendor-official caps 131072/393216) and the ensemble — selecting per request with fallback to the ensemble; the L2 DSL now has N named `profiles` + a judge with spec-defined `choices`, final-unit sampling overrides (caps min()'d with the caller), and route-aware serving gates. The ensemble (`primary`) profile is the dual-track policy-ensemble L2 DAG (DTO-D1..D12, amended by DTO-D14) over four Qwen3.8 TP1 vLLM workers (no MTP pending c16/c32 evidence) + the measured DeepSeek TP4/EP4 DSpark worker: a Qwen head streams the public opening from t=0 (semantic-TTFT gate ≤2× DeepSeek-direct, inherited); one thinking DeepSeek call writes 4 maximally different policies fanned out to 4 policy-bound Qwen answers in parallel while thinking DeepSeek critically refines a quick Qwen draft; thinking DeepSeek `synthesis` weighs the 5 candidates as peers and writes one better answer, and an inline Qwen thinking-medium (DTO-D14) `audit` (PASS/FAIL, ≤2 refinements, last attempt published on exhaustion) gates the streamed remainder (DTO-D10); a Qwen `image_description` stage runs on image requests only and feeds the text-only DeepSeek roles (DTO-D11); DeepSeek budgets halved to 8192/32768/65536 with a 65536 ceiling and Chat UI default for the Terminal-Bench 900 s turn envelope (DTO-D12). The sandbox executor stays deployed but unreferenced. Last green verify.sh runs 20260825T161729Z (coding) and 20260825T173343Z (generic) on the DTO-D8..D14 served config: coding TTFT rows all not_applicable (the judge routes every coding request to the ungated qwen_think_medium route), generic route-aware stage validation green. Composed L1 workers remain vLLM-backed until the native full-checkpoint gate closes
- Replica-pool scale-out examples (FN-D9, 2026-09-01): Qwen3.8 TP1 x 8 and DeepSeek TP4+EP4 x 2 behind one public model each; `verify.sh serving` proves the even per-replica split from the pool placement log and `verify.sh tool-calling` proves OpenAI tool calls on every replica (see their MEASUREMENTS.md); two vision replica examples (FN-D9 amendment 2026-09-04: DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp TP4+EP4 x 2, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8 TP4 x 2 on a shared upstream-main SM120 overlay image, Chat UI reasoning-effort dropdown, `verify.sh vision`) are GPU-verified (2026-09-04: pins locked, serving/tool-calling/vision gates PASS, MEASUREMENTS.md written); the Qwen example serves without the recipe's MTP k=3 because prefix caching + MTP corrupts batched output on this vLLM revision (vllm#53912)
- DeepSeek V4.1 Flash single-replica example (FN-D9 amendment, 2026-09-11) is GPU-verified on TP8/EP8 SM120 with the V4 ReplicaPool/API/UI structure and official thinking-high default; bounded L1 comparisons select DSpark 5, 16K batching and NCCL. The 320-request matrix, reasoning/tool/vision/cancellation, normal restart and retrieval through 1,039,909 prompt tokens pass; exact evidence and limitations are in its `MEASUREMENTS.md`.
- Process-split backend (`kairyu-proc`) with delta wire, TP group attestation, graceful lifecycle
- CPU suite green (thousands of tests, no selected skips); CPU microbenchmark smoke + nightly regression series in CI

### Open items / blockers

- G2 A6 performance gap vs vLLM is the open hard gate; full TP4/8 HTTP matrix deferred until closed
- Issue #333 verdict: process-split is not the A6 cause (`no_material_reduction`, ratio 0.92 vs ≤0.90 line)
- Issue #318 verdict: depth beyond the two-step admission horizon is not an A6 fix (`no_measured_benefit_depth_gt_2`)
- Production stage-sharded pipeline parallelism is a separate roadmap dependency (current PP report is not it)
- Learned-draft real-checkpoint acceptance/performance evidence remains open; FP8-E4M3 KV remains disabled after its calibrated re-bake failed exact-output and decode-envelope checks
- Frontier full-checkpoint 262K/1M correctness/performance evidence, DeepSeek EP4/EP8 topology lock, CUDA Graph pointer stability, MTP/DSpark selection, 30-minute soak, and failure recovery remain open
- NVLink-profile gates blocked on H100/A100-class hardware; PCIe-switch chassis and ≥400 Gb/s RDMA NICs gate E4/E5
- G6 remaining P-C gates still in progress
- Qwen3.8-Flash-Next MTP speculative decoding stays off in `qwen3.8-flash-next-dp2-8gpu` until upstream fixes vllm#53912 (prefix caching + MTP output corruption on hybrid GDN); single-stream decode 104 vs 175 tok/s
- DTO-D15 (2026-08-26) changed the served tiered-example config: verify.sh coding/generic gates and the digest re-pin are pending before the example status can be claimed green again
- Human sign-off pending on M2–M4 design reviews
- `qwen3.8-deepseek-v4.1-8gpu` (PR #602, V41T-D1..D6 + D1/D2 amendments): serves TP2×DP3/EP6 on the example-owned masked-KV overlay; native L1 gates and the judged serving matrices passed on the first served config; the audit protocol was amended after the first forced-ensemble row rewarded fabricated execution claims, and every public gate is being re-run on the revised specs

## Change Log

Newest first; only the most recent entries are kept here (see the size budget
in `.claude/rules/progress-log.md`).

### 2026-09-14 — [progress] Gateway self-deadlock fixed: prepared-request caches use re-entrant locks
- What: `_SHARED_PREPARED_PAYLOADS_LOCK`, `OpenAICompatBackend._prepared_payloads_lock` / `_prepared_image_urls_lock`, `KairyuBackend._prepared_requests_lock` and `ZmqEngineBackend._prepared_requests_lock` are now `threading.RLock` (the vision image cache already was). A regression test drops the last reference to a cached request while holding each cache's lock, which runs the weakref discard callback on the holding thread; it deadlocked on all five caches before and passes now. Resolves the blocker recorded in the preceding entry.
- Why: the discard callbacks run at garbage-collection time on whichever thread triggers collection, including one inside the guarded region; a non-re-entrant lock then blocks the gateway's event loop forever.
- Refs: fix PR based on PR #602; `kairyu/engine/{openai_backend,kairyu_backend,zmq_backend}.py`; `tests/unit/test_prepared_cache_discard_reentrancy.py`

### 2026-09-14 — [progress] Blocker: gateway self-deadlock in the OpenAI backend's prepared-payload cache
- What: during the V4.1 tiered example's judged c16 row the gateway froze entirely (no chat, no `/readyz`, process alive, 0 % CPU). py-spy shows the event-loop thread in `openai_backend._peek_prepared_payload` holding `_prepared_payloads_lock` (`threading.Lock`) while the weakref callback `discard`, fired by garbage collection, blocks on the same lock; `_SHARED_PREPARED_PAYLOADS_LOCK` shares the pattern. Timing-dependent (the same row passed earlier). The example restarts the gateway and re-runs its gates; `kairyu/` is untouched.
- Why: a GC-time weakref callback that takes a non-re-entrant lock can run on the thread that already holds it. Fix candidates (re-entrant lock, or a callback that never blocks) need owner authorization as a framework change.
- Refs: PR #602; `examples/qwen3.8-deepseek-v4.1-8gpu/MEASUREMENTS.md` (run 6); `kairyu/engine/openai_backend.py` `_retain_prepared_payload` / `_peek_prepared_payload` (since `1fff59db`)

### 2026-09-14 — [amendment] V41T-D2: the V4.1 tiered audit rejects unbacked execution claims
- What: the first forced-ensemble row (generic c1, 32 requests) exhausted the audit 8 times; replayed audit texts showed the benchmark row label `Run <id>, case N` extracted as a requirement to execute, honest "not executed" answers FAILed and invented execution results PASSed (25/32 published answers). The audit now accepts run/test/measure/verify claims only with the matching tool call and result, FAILs them as fabrication otherwise, and accepts a plain "cannot be performed this turn" statement; synthesis and final carry the same rule; benchmark rows label their identity as an identifier. The three replayed requests then passed on the first audit without invented results. All public gates are re-run on the revised specs.
- Why: a publication gate that rewards fabricated evidence inverts its purpose; example-owned prompt policy, Kairyu unchanged.
- Refs: PR #602 (`e8d7ba8e`); `docs/design/example-v41-tiered-orchestration.md` (V41T-D2 amendment); example `MEASUREMENTS.md` (audit diagnosis)

### 2026-09-14 — [amendment] V41T-D1: the V4.1 tiered example owns a masked-KV DeepSeek overlay
- What: on the sibling's unpatched SM120 overlay every six-GPU DeepSeek topology fails (KV allocation at 0.95 GPU-resident; illegal memory access + NCCL error in the TP sequence-parallel path with offload; NaN log-probabilities / garbage text from the second request per engine at TP1×DP6 and TP2×DP3 GPU-resident; FlashMLA rejects 64-token pages). The example now ships PR #598's overlay recipe (Dockerfile + `patch_masked_kv.py` + `patch_top_p.py`, SHA-256 pinned) built by `run.sh` on any host and attested by content; served topology TP2×DP3, EP6, Engram in pinned host memory, 0.90, 16384 batching.
- Why: owner decision — restricting the example to the sibling's image was not a requirement, and PR #598 had served six GPUs correctly on that overlay; Kairyu stays unchanged. Supersedes the plan's stop rule.
- Refs: PR #602; `docs/design/example-v41-tiered-orchestration.md` (V41T-D1 amendment); example `MEASUREMENTS.md` candidates 1–6

### 2026-09-14 — [design] V41T-D1..D6: DeepSeek V4.1 (6 GPU) + Qwen3.8 (2 GPU) tiered example
- What: new `examples/qwen3.8-deepseek-v4.1-8gpu` keeps the judged five routes; the ensemble is DeepSeek-led (PR #595 requirements checklist, four policies, four Qwen + one DeepSeek candidates, critical synthesis, final continuing the streamed Qwen head, DeepSeek audit with ≤2 refinements); a judge-free `kairyu-ensemble-max` forces the ensemble for verification; Qwen direct routes drop their fixed `max_tokens` (Issue #599); the DeepSeek image is the sibling's pinned overlay reused by ID. CPU contracts pass; no GPU evidence yet.
- Why: owner requirements (2026-09-14) with Kairyu, sibling examples, and shared scripts unchanged; the DSL offers no caller-side profile forcing and no effort floor, so a second orchestrator and `inherit` + default high are used; TP6 is invalid for the checkpoint and DSpark cannot divide EP6.
- Refs: `docs/design/example-v41-tiered-orchestration.md`; PR #602; `tests/unit/test_v41_tiered_examplectl.py`

### 2026-09-11 — [progress] V4.1 L1 selection and final GPU gates complete
- What: select TP8/EP8, DSpark 5, 16K batching and NCCL; the 320-request matrix, default/explicit reasoning, tools, images, cancellation, normal restart and four long-context retrieval smokes pass. Best measured aggregate throughput is 326.82 tok/s at c32; near-1M retrieval completes in 203.02 s.
- Why: DSpark improves c1 throughput 1.91×; EP-off exhausts KV memory at the same limits, PCIe IPC stalls during autotuning, and 8K batching shows no throughput gain. Keep unmeasured alternatives and broad quality claims outside this evidence.
- Refs: PR #597; FN-D9 V4.1 amendment; example `MEASUREMENTS.md` records exact configuration, run IDs, hashes and limitations.

### 2026-09-11 — [progress] V4.1 full-model API gates pass on TP8
- What: the SM120 overlay starts all eight GPUs, captures graphs and serves default/low/high/max reasoning, tools, images and cancellation; all initial API gates pass. UI effort selection uses the existing top-level L3 field. Performance selection and final context/restart gates remain pending.
- Why: the experimental off toggle used template kwargs rejected by the unchanged legacy L3; retaining V4's effort vocabulary keeps the requested L2/L3 structure.
- Refs: PR #597; example `MEASUREMENTS.md` initial runs `20260911T032048Z` through `20260911T032052Z`.

### 2026-09-11 — [amendment] V4.1 indexer requires 64-token blocks and MXFP4 on SM120
- What: correct the preceding 128-token manager-block candidate to 64/BLHNC, with SWA=64, C1=64, C2=32. Enable the existing MXFP4 indexer only for V4.1 on SM120. All 16 sparse-attention and four real indexer writer/prefill/decode numerical cases pass; full-model serving remains pending.
- Why: DeepGEMM rejects C1 pages of 128 and SM120 FP8 C2 pages of 32; its MXFP4 path supports both required sizes. The indexer oracle independently unpacks actual Q/K bytes (max error 2.4e-7), and CPU guards retain rejection for unverified model/device combinations.
- Refs: PR #597; FN-D9 V4.1 amendment; example `MEASUREMENTS.md`, `check_sm120_pages.py`, `check_sm120_indexer.py`. Supersedes the block-size choice in the preceding SM120 cache-compatibility entry.

### 2026-09-11 — [progress] V4.1 SM120 cache compatibility
- What: pin an example-local L1 overlay with 64-token SWA pages and C1 128-token dual-cache prefill instantiations; use manager blocks 128/BLHNC and disable unsupported adaptive verification. All 16 packed-cache GPU numerical cases pass at upstream DSV4 tolerances; full-model serving and tuning remain pending.
- Why: the official V4.1 image's SWA pages and indexer layout assumptions fail startup on SM120 before serving. Source-anchored adaptations retain the existing kernel arithmetic and keep L2/L3 unchanged.
- Refs: PR #597; `examples/deepseek-v4.1-flash-8gpu/{patch_runtime.py,check_sm120_pages.py,MEASUREMENTS.md}`; FN-D9 V4.1 amendment.

### 2026-09-11 — [amendment] FN-D9: V4.1 Flash on one eight-GPU replica
- What: add a separate V4.1 example with the existing V4 vision ReplicaPool/API/UI path; default thinking is the official high (75). Pin the checkpoint manifest and isolate runtime encoder alignment. Fixed-token measurements distinguish model output from visible content; completed-answer gates stay separate. CPU contracts pass; GPU selection is pending.
- Why: the owner revised the initial two-replica request to one TP8 replica; the initial vLLM encoder maps high differently from the checkpoint, and content-only timing mismeasures all-reasoning output.
- Refs: FN-D9 amendment in `docs/design/frontier-native-runtime.md`; `examples/deepseek-v4.1-flash-8gpu/`; implementation plan `2026-09-11-deepseek-v41-flash-example.md`.
