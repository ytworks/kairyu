## Current Status

_Last updated: 2026-07-02_

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| M1 — Orchestration (L2) + Interface (L3) | Complete and merged. Router / Conductor / MoA, vLLM-compatible `LLM` + `AsyncLLMEngine`, OpenAI-compatible server, YAML/decorator DSL. |
| M2 — Core engine (overlap scheduler + Radix-Paged KV) | CPU half done: scheduler, KV manager, EngineCore step loop, overlap pipeline, pre-GPU robustness (EOS, preemption, abort, pin TTL). Paged-KV attention validated with real tensors on CPU (greedy-equivalence). **Blocked on GPU hardware** for the GPU phase. |
| M3 — Spec decode / CUDA graphs / P-D separation | n-gram draft spec-decode policy and xgrammar structured output implemented CPU-side. CUDA graphs and the rest gated on M2 GPU phase. |
| M4 — Router learning pipeline | Implemented CPU-only (logs → distilled classifier → contextual bandit). Design reviewed. |
| M5 — Intra-node multi-GPU (TP, DP replicas, P-D intra-node) | Design reviewed; **CPU half done** (Communicator/StepInput/TPModelRunner, TP plumbing live, ReplicaPool + affinity, PDCoordinator + `resume_with_kv`). GPU phase: `docs/gpu-runbook.md` §6, prereq M2 Gates 1–3. |
| M6 — Inter-node multi-GPU (2-node DP, KV transfer plane, P-D inter-node, PP) | Design reviewed; **CPU half done** (ClusterSpec, KVTransport + loopback + `bench/kv_transfer_bench.py`, openai_backend replica fixes, async runner contract + PipelinedEngineCore). GPU phase: runbook §7, prereq all M5 gates. |
| M7 — Productionization (serve CLI, gateway wiring, batch, observability) | **In progress.** Design drafted (`docs/design/m7-productionization.md`, goal G3). CPU-verifiable scope: server hardening, `kairyu serve` + DeploymentSpec, compose topology, batch API, deployment guide. |

What works today: full stack on CPU — `kairyu` EngineBackend wired through the
OpenAI-compatible server with the mock/CPU runner; serving/router/multiturn benchmarks
in `bench/`.

Active blockers: GPU (H100/A100) required for M2 GPU phase; execution plan is
`docs/gpu-runbook.md`. Human sign-off pending on M2–M4 design reviews.

## Change Log

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] M7 Phase 3: container image, compose topology, CI smoke drill
- What: Multi-stage uv `Dockerfile` (one image for every role; the mounted
  DeploymentSpec decides gateway vs replica), `deploy/compose/` (1 gateway + 3 mock
  replicas with healthchecks, gateway/replica YAML configs), `scripts/compose_smoke.sh`
  (readiness → completion → SSE → affinity-by-metrics → replica kill/eject/zero-5xx →
  prober recovery), and a `compose-smoke` CI job separate from the coverage-gated
  pytest job. The full drill was verified end-to-end with the same configs as local
  processes (kill/eject: 10/10 subsequent 200s; prober auto-restore observed in the
  gateway JSON log); the container build itself runs in CI — this dev environment's
  network policy blocks registry CDNs.
- Refs: m7 D1/D2, G3 gates C1–C3; `Dockerfile`, `deploy/compose/`,
  `scripts/compose_smoke.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] M7 Phase 2: `kairyu serve` CLI, DeploymentSpec, pool wiring, prober, HTTP affinity
- What: `kairyu serve <deployment.yaml>` console entrypoint builds gateway or replica
  from one YAML: `DeploymentSpec` (new, composes with — does not extend — ClusterSpec,
  m7 D3) declares engines, pools (N remote `openai` members, keyless node-to-node),
  server settings, optional DSL orchestrator, batch section. Builder wraps pool members
  in `ReplicaPool` and passes it into `create_app` unchanged (the pool IS an
  EngineBackend); lifespan starts a `HealthProber` per pool (GETs ejected replicas'
  `/health`, restores via existing `probe()`) and shuts engines down gracefully.
  HTTP affinity gap closed: OpenAI `user` field / `X-Session-ID` header now map to
  `CacheHint(session_id=...)`, so external multi-turn traffic reaches the radix-KV
  warm replica (previously cache_hint was never set on the HTTP path).
- Refs: m7 D3/D4/D6; `kairyu/deploy/{spec,builder,prober}.py`,
  `kairyu/entrypoints/cli.py`, `kairyu/entrypoints/server/{app,protocol}.py`;
  tests `tests/unit/test_{deployment_spec,prober,cli}.py`,
  `tests/server/test_serve_builder.py`

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] M7 Phase 1: server hardening landed
- What: `/health`, `/readyz` (pool-aware: 503 unless every ReplicaPool has ≥1 healthy
  replica), `/metrics` (per-app Prometheus registry; request counts/latency histograms,
  scrape-time pool collector for outstanding/health/decision counts), optional static
  API-key auth (env-sourced, constant-time, health endpoints exempt), global concurrency
  guard (429 + Retry-After on /v1/*), JSON access log with X-Request-ID — all pure-ASGI
  middleware so SSE streams hold their concurrency slot to the last byte. `create_app`
  gains an optional `ServerSettings`; defaults preserve pre-M7 behavior. `ReplicaPool`
  gains read-only `healthy`/`replica_count`/`decision_counts` accessors (still no
  background tasks, m5 D4). New dep: prometheus-client.
- Refs: m7 D4/D5/D8; `kairyu/entrypoints/server/{health,metrics,middleware,settings}.py`,
  `kairyu/orchestration/replica.py`; tests `tests/server/test_{health_metrics,auth,limits}.py`

### 2026-07-02 — [design] M7 productionization designed (G3 goal, D1–D8); G2 2-node scope clarified
- What: Wrote `docs/goals/g3-production-deployment.md` (gates C1–C7) and
  `docs/design/m7-productionization.md`. Decisions: D1 on-prem-DC topology (managed
  cloud WAF/LB front → private interconnect → stateless CPU gateway tier running
  `create_app` + Orchestrator + ReplicaPool of remote `openai`-backend replicas → N GPU
  replica nodes running the same artifact); D2 no Kubernetes — systemd + docker compose
  with everything containerized and documented k3s revisit triggers; D3 new
  `DeploymentSpec` (ClusterSpec untouched — it binds the TP/PP coherence domain, not
  fleet size); D4 health/readyz/metrics + serve-layer background prober (pool stays
  passive); D5 edge-owned WAF/TLS, gateway static API keys + concurrency guard, keyless
  node-to-node; D6 cache layer = per-replica radix KV + pool session affinity, no Redis
  (revisit trigger recorded) — includes fixing the gap that the HTTP path never set
  `cache_hint`; D7 minimal filesystem-backed `/v1/files` + `/v1/batches`; D8
  prometheus-client + stdlib JSON logs, no OTel.
- Why: The product-infrastructure review (LB/scaling, WAF, k8s, GPU pool + API layer,
  cache layer, batch orchestrator, DC–cloud interconnect) found all deployment
  machinery absent: components exist in-process (ReplicaPool, remote-replica backend)
  but nothing wires, launches, secures, observes, or packages them.
- Refs: `docs/goals/g3-production-deployment.md`, `docs/design/m7-productionization.md`;
  amendment: g2 §6 "exactly 2 nodes" clarified as TP/PP coherence-domain cap, not a
  ReplicaPool fleet-size cap (`docs/goals/g2-multi-gpu.md` §6, G3 §5).

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] Repo renamed to `ytworks/kairyu`; README refreshed for M5/M6
- What: GitHub repository renamed from `ytworks/rLLM` to `ytworks/kairyu` (local origin
  updated). README brought up to date: M5/M6 rows in the roadmap, TP / P-D / KV-transport /
  PP components in architecture, engine-core and project-layout sections, test count 290+,
  clone URL. Remaining `rLLM` references in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / gpu-runbook fixed.
- Refs: README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, docs/gpu-runbook.md

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] M5/M6 GPU-independent halves implemented (177 → 289 tests)
- What: All CPU-testable pieces of both designs landed with tests (95% coverage):
  M5 — `Communicator`/`FakeCommunicator`, typed immutable `StepInput`, `TPModelRunner`
  (divergence-checked driver protocol; TP=2 greedy-equivalent to TP=1 through
  KairyuBackend), `tensor_parallel_size` plumbed end-to-end (no-op resolved),
  `ReplicaPool` (rendezvous-hash affinity, queue-depth valve, health ejection,
  `record_replica` JSONL), `PDCoordinator` + `LocalKVHandoff` + `Scheduler.resume_with_kv`
  (copy-before-commit ordering, preemption shield, P-D greedy-equivalence).
  M6 — `ClusterSpec` (topology validation), `KVTransport` protocol + `LocalFabric` +
  TCP-loopback transport, `bench/kv_transfer_bench.py` (CPU-runnable, real fragment
  layout), `openai_backend` replica fixes (real SSE streaming, pooled client, optional
  auth, token counts), async submit/handle runner contract + `PipelinedModelRunner`/
  `PipelinedEngineCore` (inter-step pipelining, bubble accounting: depth-2 <0.2 vs
  depth-1 ≈0.5 pinned by test). GPU-runbook §6/§7 added for the GPU days.
- Refs: `kairyu/engine/core/{comm,step_input,tp_runner,pd,kv_transport,pipeline}.py`,
  `kairyu/orchestration/{replica,cluster}.py`, `docs/gpu-runbook.md` §6–7

### 2026-07-02 — [design] M5/M6 designs written and reviewed (APPROVE-WITH-AMENDMENTS)
- What: `docs/design/m5-intra-node-parallelism.md` (TP runner with non-rank driver +
  typed StepInput prerequisite, ReplicaPool with session affinity, P-D copy-on-handoff
  with copy-before-commit protocol and `resume_with_kv`) and
  `docs/design/m6-inter-node-parallelism.md` (static ClusterSpec — no Ray, KVTransport
  with fragment aggregation, streamed P-D with layer-group final chunk, PP=2 via
  inter-step pipelining on an async ModelRunner handle). Three-reviewer agent panel
  fixed 6 blockers: zero-copy P-D donation withdrawn (dual-tree pool accounting unsound
  + incompatible with disjoint-GPU roles); PP intra-step micro-batching withdrawn
  (bounded at ~1.33× vs B4's 1.6×); `openai_backend` "no change" claim corrected (fake
  streaming, per-request client, mandatory auth, empty token_ids all block B1).
- Why: G2 requires reviewed design docs before implementing each milestone; review
  against the real scheduler/radix code caught mechanisms that could not work as drafted.
- Refs: `docs/design/m5-intra-node-parallelism.md` §7, `m6-inter-node-parallelism.md`
  §7, `docs/goals/g2-multi-gpu.md` §7 Amendments

### 2026-07-02 — [amendment] m1 "Ray arrives with multi-node" superseded
- What: M6 D1 uses a static ClusterSpec + torchrun-style rendezvous for the 2-node
  topology; Ray is not adopted.
- Why: G2 excludes elasticity; a dynamic-placement framework for two static nodes fails
  YAGNI. m1 §3/D4's note was forward-looking, not a binding decision.
- Refs: `docs/design/m6-inter-node-parallelism.md` D1;
  `docs/design/m1-orchestration-and-interface.md` §3

### 2026-07-02 — [design] Multi-GPU goal (G2) defined — drives M5/M6
- What: Wrote `docs/goals/g2-multi-gpu.md`, the acceptance contract for intra-node
  (M5: TP, DP replicas via L2 Router, P-D intra-node) and inter-node (M6: 2-node DP,
  page-granular KV transfer plane, P-D inter-node, PP=2) multi-GPU serving.
  Targets: Llama-3.3-70B FP8 on 8×H100 + 2 nodes (IB/RoCE); vLLM-parity-or-better plus
  absolute scaling-efficiency gates (A1–A10, B1–B5); TP=2 is the scaling base (70B FP8
  cannot run TP=1). MoE/expert parallelism is an explicit non-goal.
- Why: Multi-GPU support existed only as a no-op `tensor_parallel_size` arg and the
  P-D admission-policy half; M5/M6 need a G1-style evidence-first goal to drive
  autonomous development. `docs/goals/` created since the original G1 goal was never
  filed as a document.
- Refs: `docs/goals/g2-multi-gpu.md`; seams: `kairyu/engine/core/engine_core.py`
  (ModelRunner), `scheduler.py` (`pd_separation`), `kairyu/orchestration/router.py`

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] Design-change memory harness added
- What: Added PROGRESS.md, `.claude/rules/progress-log.md`, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md so
  Claude Code and Codex sessions share the same record of design changes and progress.
- Why: Design decisions were scattered across design docs, review-amendment commits, and
  session context; new sessions had no single place to recover project state.
- Refs: `.claude/rules/progress-log.md`

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] README enriched; GPU-day runbook added
- What: README expanded with architecture, roadmap, usage guides, and open-model setup
  (Kimi, Qwen). GPU-day runbook consolidates all remaining GPU-gated work into ordered,
  gated execution steps.
- Refs: commits 9d35360, cc45b08; `docs/gpu-runbook.md`

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] xgrammar structured output integrated (M3)
- What: Token-bitmask enforcer and `response_format` plumbing through the engine and
  OpenAI server.
- Refs: commits ad4e18c, a0851f9; `docs/design/m3-spec-decode-and-graphs.md`

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] Engine core validated end-to-end on CPU (M2 CPU half)
- What: `kairyu` EngineBackend exposed and wired through the OpenAI server; paged-KV
  attention proven greedy-equivalent with real torch tensors on CPU; pre-GPU robustness
  items landed (EOS under overlap, preemption, watermark, abort, pin TTL).
- Refs: commits 991832b, aa382f8, e977e1c; `docs/design/m2-engine.md`

### 2026-07-02 — [amendment] Design-review amendments applied (M2/M4)
- What: Compute-skip, computed gating, output caching, and bandit-router fixes applied
  across M2 KV/scheduler and M4 learning pipeline, per the agent design-review panel.
- Why: Review found gaps in the original D-decisions; docs updated with APPROVE-WITH-
  AMENDMENTS status and amendment sections (§5/§6).
- Refs: commits c14f035, 22b0b53; `docs/design/m2-engine.md` §6,
  `docs/design/m4-router-learning.md` §5

### 2026-07-02 — [design] M2–M4 designs written and reviewed; M4 pulled forward
- What: Design docs for M2 (overlap scheduler + Radix-Paged KV), M3 (spec decode, CUDA
  graphs, P-D separation), M4 (router learning) written and agent-review-approved with
  amendments. M4 was pulled ahead of schedule because it is GPU-independent.
- Why: M2's remaining half needs GPU; GPU-independent work (M3 CPU-side, M4) proceeds
  first to keep momentum.
- Refs: `docs/design/m2-engine.md`, `docs/design/m3-spec-decode-and-graphs.md`,
  `docs/design/m4-router-learning.md`; commits d2675a7, c976c64, 4d83229

### 2026-07-02 — [progress] M1 complete: orchestration + vLLM-compatible interface
- What: L2 orchestration (rule-based Router with JSONL decision log, Conductor role-DAG
  with verifier-gated refinement, MoA, immutable budget) and L3 interface
  (vLLM-signature `LLM`, `AsyncLLMEngine`, OpenAI-compatible server with SSE streaming
  and tool calls, YAML/decorator DSL) built on the `EngineBackend` protocol
  (mock / vLLM / external-OpenAI backends).
- Refs: commit 633fa37; `docs/design/m1-orchestration-and-interface.md`
