## Product

**Goal** (master roadmap `docs/roadmap.md`, accepted 2026-07-03): serve a
Fugu-class orchestration product — multi-model auto-routing plus agent
ensemble/synthesis behind one OpenAI-compatible API and a chat UI — from an
on-prem DC of thousands of GPUs across **two first-class hardware profiles**:
NVLink-HBM nodes (8× H100-class, TP-first) and PCIe-GDDR nodes (RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell, DP-first / PP for capacity / EP over RDMA). TTFT/TPOT/goodput must
beat frontier APIs as measured by the committed harness (G6 gate P-C1).

- L1 stays Kairyu's own engine (kernel libraries like FlashInfer are used;
  scheduler, radix KV, spec decode, orchestration are ours). Layering:
  L3 Interface / L2 Orchestration / L1 Engines.
- Target model classes: small dense ~14B (latency tier), mid dense ~70B,
  mid MoE 100–300B, frontier MoE 500B+ (multi-node EP).
- Parallelism/quantization strategy is derived per measured hardware profile,
  never assumed. Details: `docs/goals/g2..g6-*.md`.

## Current Status

Snapshot date: 2026-09-08. Hardware context: all GPU evidence so far is on
8× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (SM120), PCIe-only interconnect (P2P 30–37 GB/s);
NVLink-HBM (H100-class) formal gates still need hardware. Evidence lives in
`bench/results/` (see `index.json`); decisions and rationale in `docs/design/`.

### Formal gates

- G2 A1: complete — TP1/2 logprob-agreement closure on Llama-3.1-8B
- G2 A2: complete — TP2/4/8 closure on Llama-3.3-70B FP8-dynamic
- G2 A6 (perf vs vLLM): **open** — TP4 ShareGPT 0.466× SLO-goodput HTTP; matrix deferred while gap closes
- G2 A7: closed — >80% KV cache-hit rates on Qwen3-32B TP4/TP8, direct and gateway
- G2 A8 (DP scaling): `passed: false` (1.7993× vs 1.9× threshold); owner accepted as explicit closure deviation
- G2 A9: closed — DP=2×TP4 vs TP8 production-topology report on Qwen3-32B
- A12 (batch-invariance determinism, #360): closed — exact-match verdict passed on Qwen3-32B TP8
- #356 real-checkpoint quant parity: evidence complete — INT8 PASS; AWQ/GPTQ formal FAIL retained with SHA-bound same-GPU oracle replay isolating checkpoint quantization loss
- B7 (KV answer-equivalence, #373): operator implemented and portable-validated; additive over F2/F4
- G4 MoE: M-A1 formal FAIL retained; M-A2 complete; M-A3 scope-closed by owner deviation (perf gate stays FAIL); dense BF16 MoE uses sort-by-expert grouped GEMM and fixed-capacity EP transport, then combines returned rows in fixed FP32 order before one model-dtype cast
- G4 E-KV: unit-scale and calibrated per-layer K/V FP8-E4M3 re-bakes **FAIL** retained; calibrated cache metrics/logprobs pass but 16K/32K exact tokens and decode envelope do not; `fp8_e4m3` startup rejected
- G5: F1a–F1d, F2a–F2d, F4a, F4b all closed; F4c decided (keep per-replica RadixKV + F2 routing, thresholded revisit)
- F5a/b/c (priority, noisy-neighbor, SLO admission): closed
- G6: P-A, P-B1–P-B4, P-C2/C3/C4 green (incl. Open WebUI P-B3 browser gate); remaining P-C gates continue
- #150 TP8 long-generation stability gate: passed after deadlock fix; #364 `logits_dtype`: valid negative, withdrawn

### What works today

- `kairyu serve --tp N` on real hardware: Qwen3-32B TP8, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.3-70B FP8, Qwen3-VL-32B (via vLLM replica)
- Attention backends: `auto`/torch/FlashInfer/FA3/FA4 with `/backends` reporting; capable CUDA models pre-capture decode graphs before readiness
- Quantized serving: FP8/INT8/AWQ/GPTQ/NVFP4 without full dequantization; opt-in FP8 EAGLE/MTP draft loading
- Incremental architecture-state paths for Qwen3.6 and DeepSeek V4 plus an explicit recompute diagnostic mode; DeepSeek EP2/4/8 Attention-DP and direct packed-FP4 execution are implemented, with SM120 single-kernel and two-rank NCCL smokes green
- Device-side sampling, penalties, spec verification, page-table caching; TP step headers sleep on Gloo while fixed-layout delta payloads use the bounded NCCL model group and rare controls remain Gloo objects; structured masks stay on CUDA with only selected IDs returned to the host matcher; deterministic n-gram/EAGLE-3/MTP drafts preserve T>0 and penalized sampling
- Hardened gateway: auth, tenancy metering/invoicing, priority + SLO admission, batch API, embeddings/RAG, Responses API
- Orchestration (Conductor/MoA) with streaming, usage accounting, trace v2; assistant history round-trips typed `reasoning_content` while assistant-only LiteLLM provider objects and nullable legacy function calls are ignored before rendering and other extras remain fail-closed; MoA keeps the original response contract distinct from untrusted candidate drafts, with configured completion delimiters and the multi-stage boundary withholding private synthesis reasoning; prefix-aware replica placement obeys the configured queue-depth overload valve; Codex CLI and IDE tool-calling work end-to-end, including AUTO models over /v1/responses (#530)
- Fleet: 3-gateway HA with PostgreSQL BatchStore, KV-aware prefix routing, DRAM KV tiering, Helm chart + kind CI drill
- Checkout-only eval tooling retains explicit Core, Quantization, Structured Output, and Long Context suites with hash-chained quality history, config A/B comparisons, and quantization sweeps; Kairyu correctness and performance gates are owned by `verification/`, not evals
- The tiered RTX PRO example (DTO-D13, 2026-08-22) puts a bounded Qwen non-thinking route judge in front of five profiles — four single-call direct routes (Qwen non-thinking, Qwen thinking-medium, DeepSeek non-thinking on the re-added `tier2-direct` pool, DeepSeek thinking at the L3 effort; official per-mode sampling fixed on the final unit, vendor-official caps 131072/393216) and the ensemble — selecting per request with fallback to the ensemble; the L2 DSL now has N named `profiles` + a judge with spec-defined `choices`, final-unit sampling overrides (caps min()'d with the caller), and route-aware serving gates. The ensemble (`primary`) profile is the dual-track policy-ensemble L2 DAG (DTO-D1..D12, amended by DTO-D14) over four Qwen3.8 TP1 vLLM workers (no MTP pending c16/c32 evidence) + the measured DeepSeek TP4/EP4 DSpark worker: a Qwen head streams the public opening from t=0 (semantic-TTFT gate ≤2× DeepSeek-direct, inherited); one thinking DeepSeek call writes 4 maximally different policies fanned out to 4 policy-bound Qwen answers in parallel while thinking DeepSeek critically refines a quick Qwen draft; thinking DeepSeek `synthesis` weighs the 5 candidates as peers and writes one better answer, and an inline Qwen thinking-medium (DTO-D14) `audit` (PASS/FAIL, ≤2 refinements, last attempt published on exhaustion) gates the streamed remainder (DTO-D10); a Qwen `image_description` stage runs on image requests only and feeds the text-only DeepSeek roles (DTO-D11); DeepSeek budgets halved to 8192/32768/65536 with a 65536 ceiling and Chat UI default for the Terminal-Bench 900 s turn envelope (DTO-D12). The sandbox executor stays deployed but unreferenced. Last green verify.sh runs 20260825T161729Z (coding) and 20260825T173343Z (generic) on the DTO-D8..D14 served config: coding TTFT rows all not_applicable (the judge routes every coding request to the ungated qwen_think_medium route), generic route-aware stage validation green. Composed L1 workers remain vLLM-backed until the native full-checkpoint gate closes
- Replica-pool scale-out examples (FN-D9, 2026-09-01): Qwen3.8 TP1 x 8 and DeepSeek TP4+EP4 x 2 behind one public model each; `verify.sh serving` proves the even per-replica split from the pool placement log and `verify.sh tool-calling` proves OpenAI tool calls on every replica (see their MEASUREMENTS.md); two vision replica examples (FN-D9 amendment 2026-09-04: DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp TP4+EP4 x 2, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8 TP4 x 2 on a shared upstream-main SM120 overlay image, Chat UI reasoning-effort dropdown, `verify.sh vision`) are GPU-verified (2026-09-04: pins locked, serving/tool-calling/vision gates PASS, MEASUREMENTS.md written); the Qwen example serves without the recipe's MTP k=3 because prefix caching + MTP corrupts batched output on this vLLM revision (vllm#53912)
- Process-split backend (`kairyu-proc`) with delta wire, TP group attestation, graceful lifecycle
- CPU suite green (thousands of tests, no selected skips); CPU microbenchmark smoke + nightly regression series in CI

### Open items / blockers

- G2 A6 performance gap vs vLLM is the open hard gate; full TP4/8 HTTP matrix deferred until closed
- Issue #333 verdict: process-split is not the A6 cause (`no_material_reduction`, ratio 0.92 vs ≤0.90 line)
- Issue #318 verdict: depth beyond the two-step admission horizon is not an A6 fix (`no_measured_benefit_depth_gt_2`)
- Production stage-sharded pipeline parallelism is a separate roadmap dependency (current PP report is not it)
- Learned-draft real-checkpoint acceptance/performance evidence remains open; FP8-E4M3 KV remains disabled after its calibrated re-bake failed exact-output and decode-envelope checks
- Frontier full-checkpoint 262K/1M correctness/performance evidence, DeepSeek EP4/EP8 topology lock, CUDA Graph pointer stability, MTP/DSpark selection, 30-minute soak, and failure recovery remain open
- NVLink-profile gates blocked on H100/A100-class hardware; PCIe-switch chassis and ≥400 Gb/s RDMA NICs gate E4/E5
- G6 remaining P-C gates still in progress
- Qwen3.8-Flash-Next MTP speculative decoding stays off in `qwen3.8-flash-next-dp2-8gpu` until upstream fixes vllm#53912 (prefix caching + MTP output corruption on hybrid GDN); single-stream decode 104 vs 175 tok/s
- DTO-D16 quality counterexamples are closed by nine-case GPU API verification and same-config direct-route smoke; generic serving passes 128/128 on the same quality-fixed config. Normal default-launch portability verification is in progress. Coding routes are unchanged; no new coding latency claim is made. Example-only root output reserves and audit regex preserve fixed medium thinking and caller totals. Full answers, audits, runtime/config hashes, and retained failed trials: tiered example `MEASUREMENTS.md` and `measurements/20260908-requirements-quality-final.json`.
- Human sign-off pending on M2–M4 design reviews

## Change Log

Newest first; only the most recent entries are kept here (see the size budget
in `.claude/rules/progress-log.md`).

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: reproducible default example launch
- What: explicitly select and validate the pinned non-root DeepSeek image recipe; move its cache to a dedicated UID-owned mount, use root only for storage setup/download, and persist/adopt the API compaction key privately.
- Why: the previous default image could not traverse `/root/.cache`, while the running stack relied on an unrecorded cachefix image and externally supplied secret. Same-GPU host portability requires a complete default recipe, not merely hardware-independent config hashes.
- Refs: tiered example `control.py`, `compose.yaml`, README prerequisites; 138 focused CPU tests pass. Pre-change generic run `20260908T101744Z` passes 128/128; normal default-launch GPU validation pending.

### 2026-09-08 — [progress] DTO-D16: nine-case GPU quality verification passes
- What: all nine original API cases pass automated and manual review on one served config; root budget logs correlate exactly 9/9 requirements and 3/3 images, all 12 audits use the regex format, and direct-route smoke passes without hook application. Every final answer, checklist, and audit is retained.
- Why: repeated serial/concurrent evidence closes the observed root-output and audit counterexamples; format constraints alone are not a semantic guarantee. Two JSON cases and one image case demonstrate FAIL → repair → PASS.
- Refs: tiered example `measurements/20260908-requirements-quality-final.json`; run `20260908T094200Z`; final-config serving re-measurement remains pending.

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: constrain audit verdict serialization
- What: an example-only vLLM regex constrains audit output to a bare verdict and complete evidence/repair rows, matching the full rendered template and exact bounded retry suffix. Existing medium effort, sampling, and 16384-token cap remain unchanged.
- Why: a direct audit detects semantic defects but emits `PASS or FAIL?` before FAIL, unsafe for the existing prefix parser. The quality parser also distinguishes concrete evidence from repair-only text and permits properly assessed added IDs without hiding unresolved findings.
- Refs: DTO-D16; tiered example `requirements_budget.py`, `requirements_quality.py`; positive/negative GPU probes and full API re-verification pending.

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: audit claim scope and recommendation counts
- What: the nine-case API run produces all checklists and image descriptions, with exact 9/3 budget-log correlation. The measurement parser accepts concrete three-column satisfied assessments; synthesis/audit instructions check recommendation counts across branches and reject unsupported universal claims.
- Why: compact satisfied rows retained all evidence but failed label parsing; separately, an image answer passed model audit despite overgeneralizing color perception and recommending two conditional alternatives when one was requested. The latter remains a real quality failure; all nine answers and audits are retained.
- Refs: DTO-D16; tiered example `measurements/20260908-nine-case-audit-failure.json`; repeated GPU verification pending.

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: reserve image-description output
- What: the image root now clearly performs internal perception only and receives a 2048-token thinking budget within its unchanged 4096 total; the same exact-template example middleware applies the reserve without a JSON schema. Requirement settings remain unchanged. Matched image seeds 603/604/605 produce nonempty grounded descriptions in 370/504/1083 tokens.
- Why: the API trial spent all 4096 image tokens debating the final-answer instructions and emitted no description, despite complete requirements and a final audit PASS. The image gate correctly rejects this separate empty-output failure.
- Refs: DTO-D16; tiered example `measurements/20260908-image-description-failure-and-probes.json`; full API and serving re-verification pending.

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: preserve literal criteria and bounded openings
- What: the first tuned API trial emits a complete checklist but exceeds the answer word limit and emits a misleading audit heading. Require exact literals in acceptance criteria (source-only matches fail), keep the committed opening within one short sentence, and reinforce single-word audit verdicts and combined-answer length limits.
- Why: the first trial's correct source quotation hid a missing punctuation mark in its criterion; a 405-word answer and `PASS/FAIL assessment:` preceding FAIL were not caught by the framework's prefix verdict parsing. Example quality checks reject them; audit budgets were not exhausted (7309/9190 tokens).
- Refs: DTO-D16; tiered example `measurements/20260908-first-tuned-api-failure.json`; repeated GPU re-verification pending.

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: reserve checklist output tokens
- What: example-local vLLM middleware caps requirements thinking at 2048 within an 8192-token total; fixed medium thinking and framework code stay unchanged. A repeated real-API gate checks complete checklist coverage, audit IDs/evidence, final minimum satisfaction, and image-root overlap.
- Why: prompt-only extraction still exhausted its budget; explicit reasoning/output allocation completes all four adopted direct-worker probes without dropping mandatory constraints. Full tuned API and serving re-verification remains pending.
- Refs: DTO-D16 tuning amendment in `docs/design/example-dual-track-orchestration.md`; tiered example `requirements_budget.py`, `requirements_quality.py`, `MEASUREMENTS.md`.

### 2026-09-08 — [progress] DTO-D16: GPU checklist quality counterexamples
- What: the current PR config passes 128 generic serving requests, but two of three diagnostic quality cases emit no requirement checklist after spending all 4096 tokens in reasoning; the image case produces R1–R11 with parallel image/checklist roots. Final-answer checks pass in all three cases, so final audit PASS does not close checklist quality.
- Why: successful internal-stage traces do not require nonempty output, and internal requirements do not receive the final-unit empty-output retry; GPU evidence exposes a failure hidden by scripted responses.
- Refs: `examples/qwen3.8-deepseek-v4-8gpu/MEASUREMENTS.md`; `measurements/20260908-requirements-quality.json` in that example; generic run `20260908T043120Z`.

### 2026-09-08 — [amendment] DTO-D16: ensemble audits request requirements
- What: the example adds a Qwen3.8 medium-thinking requirements root beside image description, passes stable criteria to answer stages, and asks the final audit to judge every item with evidence and repair guidance; call budget becomes 20 with two refinements.
- Why: general task requirements need explicit minimum-quality checks independent of candidate drafts; no program execution or framework changes are required.
- Refs: DTO-D16 in `docs/design/example-dual-track-orchestration.md`; `examples/qwen3.8-deepseek-v4-8gpu/`; `tests/unit/test_tiered_requirement_dag.py`; GPU gates and config digest re-pin pending
