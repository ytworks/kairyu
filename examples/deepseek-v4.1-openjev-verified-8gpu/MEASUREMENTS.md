# deepseek-v4.1-openjev-verified-8gpu evidence

Host: 8 x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition (SM120), PCIe. DeepSeek-V4.1
DP6/EP6 on GPUs 0-5 (image `sha256:119afb09…`, the six-GPU example's SM120
overlay), OpenJev 0.5.1 (`sha256:65f88680…`, unmodified) on GPU 6 and GPU 7.
Raw evidence: `/mnt/nvme/kairyu/model-volumes/deepseek-v4.1-openjev-verified-8gpu/`
(`calibration/`, `results/`).

## Readiness (2026-10-01)

`run.sh up` probes: every DeepSeek DP rank answers the `{"answer": 323}`
json_schema probe in thinking and chat mode; each OpenJev replica answers a
two-question System One read (billing yes, weather no); one verified request
returns `kairyu_verification`.

## Jev input/output (2026-10-01)

OpenJev (Jev wire API) builds a system prompt "Answer a fixed set of
questions about the state the user provides", lists each question as
`Question qN: <instructions>` with `yes: <criteria.true>` / `no:
<criteria.false>`, sends the state as the user turn, and reads one label
token per question from a 64-token canvas (about 10 questions per read;
larger sets are split into parallel reads; uncertain slots re-read 3 times).

Request form A/B on all 1,129 InFoBench expert labels (OpenJev only, the
model answers as given):

| Form | AUROC | acc@0.5 | Brier | accepted p>=0.9 | violations |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| free-text state, declarative statement, no criteria | 0.814 | 0.840 | 0.141 | 894 | 98 (11.0 %) |
| **JSON state, `{question, requirement}` object, yes/no criteria** | **0.830** | **0.850** | **0.133** | 860 | **80 (9.3 %)** |
| InFoBench question as-is | 0.821 | 0.841 | 0.139 | 876 | 88 |
| any of the above with `think: 512` | 0.789-0.802 | | worse | | more |

The second form is what m1 D8's conversion produces.

Two exchange defects found on the GPUs and fixed:

- The extractor read Kairyu's L2 `{query}`, whose wrapper instructs the
  answer writer ("Return only the assistant response body", ...); DeepSeek
  extracted those sentences as the user's instruction units, so curation
  replaced real requirements with padding and the probe ended at
  `refinement_limit`. Roles that analyse the request now read
  `{conversation}` (the role-tagged messages only). After the fix the probe
  "Name the capital of France in one word, then explain why in one sentence"
  extracts R1-R4 (one word / order / explains why / one sentence) and is
  guaranteed on attempt 1 (162 s, 26,719 internal output tokens).
- DeepSeek-V4.1 thinks unless `enable_thinking: false` is sent (120-340
  reasoning tokens on a "non-thinking" call, occasionally an empty answer).
  The pool now allows that kwarg, so the state builder runs in chat mode.

## Explicit-points check, tried and removed (2026-10-03, 10:24-11:10 JST, `3c96d9a8`)

InFoBench rows 40-119 (the requirements gate uses rows 0-39), production API,
8 concurrent. Label: the gate's coverage judge on the first explicit list
(all gold questions covered: 71 of 80). The first lists covered 96.2 % of
the gold questions (after one re-extraction 95.2 %); 3 had a duplicate pair.

| sufficiency cut | re-extracted | of them already complete | incomplete lists passed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 2 | 2 | 9 of 9 |
| 0.5 | 20 | 18 | 7 of 9 |
| 0.9 | 44 | 41 | 6 of 9 |

Sufficiency AUROC 0.41. The per-point necessity question has no gold label
(at 0.5 it failed 98 of 483 points, in 25 lists, 23 of them complete). The
owner removed the check. The same run showed adoption with no implicit point
unavailable (14 of 66 runs unverified), fixed by `on_empty: pass`.

## Acceptance read for VCO-D15 item 7 (2026-10-03, `cf4ad653`)

InFoBench (249 answers; an answer is acceptable when every expert label is
yes: 125), the same split as below, cached per-point p from the coverage
calibration (`judged-coverage-v2.jsonl`). One acceptance read per answer:
the prompt, the answer and the point results `{id, point, p, passed}`.
Variants differ in the question and state (`calibrate.py` runs production).

| variant | AUROC | best calibration upper bound (response level) |
|---|---|---|
| "May this answer be adopted as the official reply?" + results | 0.787 | 0.339 |
| same question, no results | 0.786 | 0.326 |
| point statements only, "meets every point?" | 0.799 | 0.377 |
| strict "does everything the prompt asks?" + results | 0.789 | 0.348 |
| missed points only | 0.795 | 0.379 |
| **"can it be adopted as the reply the user expects?" + results (production)** | **0.809** | **0.259** |
| reference: every point p >= tau_hi (no acceptance read) | 0.800 (min p) | 0.396 |

No variant and no threshold meets alpha 0.10 at 95 % at the response level.
Production thresholds (held-out half, 125 answers):

| tau_accept | guaranteed | missing a requirement | rate | upper bound |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 59 | 14 | 23.7 % | 34.6 % |
| 0.9 | 52 | 10 | 19.2 % | 30.4 % |
| **0.99 (owner choice)** | **43** | **7** | **16.3 %** | **28.4 %** |
| 0.999 | 24 | 4 | 16.7 % | 34.2 % |

### Point results in the acceptance read: with (X) or without (Y) (2026-10-03, 08:43-08:44 JST)

Same 249 answers and split, measured back to back. X is production (prompt,
candidate answer and point results); Y gives the prompt and the candidate
answer only ("Reading the prompt and the candidate answer, can this answer
be adopted as the reply the user expects?"). The owner kept X.

| | AUROC | best calibration upper bound | held-out at 0.99 |
|---|---|---|---|
| X (rerun) | 0.805 | 0.238 | 45 guaranteed, 7 missing a requirement (15.6 %, upper 27.2 %) |
| Y | 0.754 | 0.416 | 62 guaranteed, 20 missing a requirement (32.3 %, upper 43.3 %) |

Caveat: in this calibration the points whose results X reads are
InFoBench's own labelled requirements (rewritten as statements), the same
items the response label is built from; in serving the points come from the
extractors. X's advantage here may be larger than in serving. "Missing a
requirement" means at least one expert label is no; it stands in for "not
the reply the user expects", which InFoBench does not label directly.

## Coverage calibration for VCO-D15 (2026-10-02, 23:33-00:05 JST)

InFoBench expert labels (249 answers, 1,129 labels, 239 violations), the same
split as below (25 / 25 instructions, seed 20261001), alpha 0.10 at 95 %.
DeepSeek rewrites each labelled question as a point; OpenJev reads one
coverage question per point through the production checklist code, every
point of an answer in one System One request. Variants differ only in the
coverage question and its state, measured on the same point statements
(`coverage_variants`; production `calibrate.py` re-run below).

| Variant | state | question | AUROC | tau_hi | held-out acceptance | held-out upper bound | held-out answers passing every point |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| earlier design (2026-10-01) | conversation, checklist, answer, claims | does the answer satisfy the requirement | 0.850 | 0.9966 | - | 8.7 % | 54 / 125 |
| V0 (owner's first form) | answer | does the answer contain this point | 0.791 | 0.99966 | 49 % | **12.4 %** | 20 / 125 |
| V1 | request, answer | contain | 0.809 | 0.99973 | 53 % | **11.1 %** | 23 / 125 |
| V2 | answer | satisfy the requirement (default) | 0.815 | 0.999986 | 26 % | 8.4 % | 4 / 125 |
| V3 | answer | strict | 0.815 | 0.9977 | 52 % | 9.7 % | 19 / 125 |
| V4 | request, answer | strict | 0.848 | 0.9950 | 59 % | 7.9 % | 39 / 125 |
| **V5 (adopted)** | **request, history, answer** | **strict** | **0.852** | **0.9894** | **64 %** | **8.6 %** | **45 / 125** |

Strict question: "Does the answer fully and correctly do what this point
requires?" (yes: every part met exactly as the point states it; no: missing,
partly met or met incorrectly). The history summary is the production
`history` role (non-thinking DeepSeek); InFoBench requests are single turns, so
247 of 249 summaries are "none". V0 and V1 fail alpha on the held-out half;
V5 is the configuration in `verified.yaml`.

Production re-run (`./verify.sh calibrate`, statements and history summaries
regenerated, `calibration/judged-coverage-v2.jsonl`, `calibration/tau.json`):

| Half | tau | accepted | violations | rate | upper bound |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| calibration | 0.98887 | 383 (70 %) | 28 | 7.3 % | 9.89 % |
| held-out | 0.98887 | 374 (64 %) | 25 | 6.7 % | 9.21 % |

Held-out answers passing every point: 45 / 125 (7 violated). The threshold 0.9895 is at
least both calibrated values (0.98941, 0.98887).

## tau_hi calibration (2026-10-01)

`./verify.sh calibrate`, full production checklist path (DeepSeek rewrites
each InFoBench question as a condition, the state builder lists claims,
OpenJev reads through the two-replica System One backend). Split by
instruction (25 / 25, seed 20261001).

| | labels | violations | AUROC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| all | 1,129 | 239 | 0.850 |

| tau | requirements accepted | violation rate | 95 % upper bound | answers with every requirement >= tau | of which violated |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.99 | 74 % | 8.8 % | 10.6 % | 123 / 249 | 31 |
| 0.995 | 71 % | 7.5 % | 9.2 % | 113 / 249 | 25 |
| 0.999 | 65 % | 5.9 % | 7.5 % | 97 / 249 | 20 |

alpha = 0.05 is reachable only at p = 1.0 exactly (about 10 % of
requirements). Variants measured on the same cached DeepSeek outputs
(violations among p >= 0.999):

| Variant | AUROC | accepted | violations | upper bound |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| production form | 0.851 | 736 | 46 | 0.079 |
| state = conversation + answer | 0.826 | 651 | 45 | 0.088 |
| state = answer only | 0.808 | 621 | 46 | 0.094 |
| one question per read | 0.826 | 606 | 47 | 0.098 |
| stricter yes/no criteria | 0.842 | 647 | 40 | 0.080 |
| all three combined | 0.803 | 287 | 20 | 0.100 |
| `steps: 4` | 0.846 | | | |
| `samples: 8` | 0.851 | | | |
| atomized requirements, min | 0.804 | 475 | 31 | 0.087 |

Label noise floor (two expert annotators per answer, 1,123 pairs): the
annotators disagree on 10.2 %; when annotator 1 says "satisfied" the official
label says "violated" 9.1 % of the time (annotator 2: 10.0 %). Owner decision:
alpha = 0.10.

Result (alpha = 0.10, 95 % confidence): **tau_hi = 0.9966**.

| Half | accepted | violations | rate | upper bound |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| calibration | 392 | 29 | 7.4 % | 9.95 % |
| held-out | 398 | 25 | 6.3 % | 8.66 % |

Held-out answers: 54 / 125 pass every requirement; 10 of them carry at least
one labelled violation.

## Per-claim G1 calibration (2026-10-02, VCO-D11; computation and general removed by VCO-D12)

`./verify.sh calibrate-g1`: 600 human-labelled answers per claim kind, the
production state builder (DeepSeek, high effort, claims grammar) and the
production G1 questions read by both OpenJev replicas through `ChecklistRun`.
Split by problem / source document / Wikipedia page (seed 20261001). Raw rows:
`results/g1-calibration-20261001T161504Z.json`, `calibration/g1/tau.json`.

| Kind (data) | answers (violated) | AUROC | tau 0.9 acc / viol | tau 0.99 acc / viol | tau 0.999 acc / viol | calibrated tau | held-out |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1-source (RAGTruth, any span) | 599 (237) | 0.694 | 173 / 41 | 157 / 37 | 141 / 33 | none | — |
| G1-computation (PRM800K phase 2, a -1 step; balanced) | 595 (299) | 0.704 | 198 / 78 | 185 / 74 | 178 / 69 | none | — |
| G1-general (FEVER dev, REFUTES) | 594 (293) | 0.893 | 296 / 53 | 251 / 38 | 197 / 22 | 0.99926 (89 acc, 4 viol, ub 0.0999) | 99 acc, 15 viol, ub 0.224: FAIL |

Answers passing every G1 kind at p >= 0.99: RAGTruth 138 (22 violated),
PRM800K 196 (75), FEVER 254 (38). Accepted RAGTruth violations are mostly
"Baseless Info" (45 spans) rather than "Conflict" (9): true but unsourced
additions that G1's "well-established knowledge" accepts. Accepted PRM800K
violations list the erroneous step as a claim and OpenJev calls it
supported; FEVER violations include "Fringe debuted in 2011" at p 0.9996.
Outcome (owner option A): the G1 questions are advisory (threshold 0).

Cost: 1,800 state-builder calls, 10,557 / 8,404 / 422 median output tokens
(RAGTruth / PRM800K / FEVER; 91 % thinking), p50 142 / 110 / 8 s at 32 in
flight, 74 tok/s per request, 2,370-2,500 tok/s DeepSeek generation, DSpark
acceptance 57-61 %; about 85 minutes in all. 12 state-builder outputs (0.7 %)
were truncated JSON (runaway newlines) and are excluded.

## GPU gates on `e81db571` (2026-10-02, 13:22-16:30 JST)

Every gate passes. Raw rows: `results/*-20261002T0[4-7]*Z.json`.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `l1` | PASS: grammar probes on every DP rank, System One on both replicas |
| `routing` | PASS: 80 conversations judged in 1.41 s; held-out miss rate 0.0; everyday to think 1.0 |
| `effort` | PASS: default/low/high/max reach every DeepSeek step on both routes |
| `think-route` | PASS: 6/6 think, p50 1.09 s, TTFT p50 0.85 s |
| `implicit` | PASS: recall 0.875 (gate 0.80), controls 0.0, 27/30 guaranteed, p50 89 s |
| `requirements` (40 InFoBench, c8) | PASS: gold recall 0.972 (gate 0.90), 40/40 judged, 17 guaranteed, p50 342 s / p95 537 s |
| `repair` (16, c8) | PASS: 14 guaranteed, 0 guaranteed answers violate their constraint, p50 103 s |

| `serving` (InFoBench, kairyu-verified-always) | PASS (table below) |
| `serving-routed` (routing set, kairyu-verified) | PASS (table below) |
| `browser-smoke.sh` | PASS after the gate script closes Open WebUI's "new version (v0.11.4) available" notice, which covered the model selector |

Serving (InFoBench; per row: requests / guaranteed / latency p50 / p95 /
internal input / output tokens / aggregate output tok/s / req/min):

| c | n | guaranteed | p50 / p95 s | tokens in / out | tok/s | req/min |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| c1 | 8 | 4 (50 %) | 154 / 261 | 106,478 / 276,551 | 211 | 0.37 |
| c4 | 16 | 7 (44 %) | 221 / 384 | 247,646 / 524,539 | 540 | 0.99 |
| c8 | 16 | 8 (50 %) | 218 / 549 | 246,750 / 590,312 | 869 | 1.41 |
| c16 | 32 | 17 (53 %) | 191 / 507 | 382,164 / 844,110 | 1,347 | 3.06 |

(5b455dd8: 25-38 % guaranteed, p50 141-260 s.)

Serving-routed (Jev picks the route per conversation):

| c | verified n / guaranteed | verified p50 / p95 s | think n | think p50 / p95 s | tok/s | req/min |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| c1 | 7 / 7 | 95 / 139 | 1 | 0.5 | 208 | 0.61 |
| c4 | 10 / 3 | 235 / 345 | 6 | 1.5 / 1.8 | 492 | 1.21 |
| c8 | 10 / 6 | 184 / 405 | 6 | 3.3 / 5.9 | 663 | 2.02 |
| c16 | 16 / 12 | 307 / 545 | 16 | 3.3 / 8.3 | 946 | 2.81 |

Verified route overall 28/43 guaranteed (65 %). The owner latency target
(p50 <= 3 minutes on long InFoBench requests) is not met: p50 154-342 s
across gates; first-attempt guarantees take 50-120 s, failed repairs
200-650 s.

## Two-stage extraction and latency (2026-10-02, VCO-D8 amendment 2, VCO-D12)

Implicit conditions, extraction plus OpenJev only (no answer generation;
dev set of 12 + 4 controls written before tuning; the gate's 20 + 10):

| Configuration | gate-set recall | dev-set recall | controls (implicit kept) | implicit kept per request |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| one prompt, situational guidance | 0.875 | 0.917-0.958 | 0.0 | 2.2 |
| two-stage | 0.900-0.925 | 0.917-0.958 | 0.0-0.2 | 4.7 |
| two-stage, at most four | 0.925-0.950 | 1.000 | 0.0-0.4 | 2.6-2.75 |

Full-DAG implicit gate runs before the split: recall 0.525 (first run),
0.600, 0.675; re-extraction dropped implicit conditions. The InFoBench
requirements gate on the one-prompt build: gold recall 0.867, p50 471 s
(stated conditions 4.5 per request vs 5.1 without implicit ones).

Latency, 8 InFoBench requests at c8 with traces (seconds; mean per call):

| Configuration | p50 / max | extract | implicit | answer | state builder | guaranteed |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| two-stage | 492 / 587 | 88 | 112 | 34 | 92 (10,491 tok) | 1 / 8 (3 `budget`) |
| + state builder lists source / action claims | 355 / 455 | 82 | 125 | 31 | 43 (4,914 tok) | 2 / 8 (1 `budget`) |
| + step budget 24 | 297 / 432 | 89 | 110 | 23 | 44 (5,109 tok) | 3 / 8 |

The fastest guaranteed request took 166 s (one attempt).

## GPU gates on the final code (2026-10-01, `5b455dd8` plus the G3/report fixes)

Raw rows: `results/{structured,requirements,serving}-2026100*T11*Z.json`,
`results/serving-20261001T124829Z.json`. Every request routes through the
verified DAG (`multi_agent`); tokens are internal orchestration totals
(DeepSeek + System One).

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `l1` (readiness) | PASS: JSON-grammar probe on every DP rank, thinking and chat; System One on each OpenJev replica |
| `repair` (16 constraint requests, c8) | PASS: 16/16 answered, 13 guaranteed, 5 repaired, 0 guaranteed answers violate their stated constraint (independent check); p50 65 s, p95 186 s |
| `structured` (caller json_schema) | PASS: schema-valid and guaranteed |
| `fallback` | PASS: one OpenJev down still guaranteed; both down 200 + `judge_unavailable`; recovered |
| `requirements` (40 InFoBench, c8) | PASS: gold-question recall 0.901 on all 40; 11 guaranteed, 36 repaired; p50 209 s, p95 421 s; 772 output tok/s aggregate |
| `serving` (InFoBench, c1/c4/c8/c16) | PASS: every request answered with a flag (table below) |
| `browser-smoke.sh` | PASS: badge "Guaranteed", answer "red, blue, yellow" |

Serving (each row: requests / ok / guaranteed / repaired / mean attempts /
latency p50 / p95 / per-request internal input / output tokens (median) /
per-request output tok/s median (range) / aggregate output tok/s / req/min):

| c | n | ok | guaranteed | repaired | attempts | latency p50 / p95 s | tokens in / out | tok/s per request | aggregate tok/s | req/min |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| c1 | 8 | 8 | 2 (25 %) | 8 | 2.75 | 141.1 / 221.1 | 11,134 / 27,416 | 180.9 (160.7-206.2) | 185.9 | 0.39 |
| c4 | 16 | 16 | 5 (31 %) | 15 | 2.69 | 153.5 / 293.5 | 11,158 / 21,982 | 141.9 (121.7-153.6) | 525.7 | 1.38 |
| c8 | 16 | 16 | 6 (38 %) | 11 | 2.31 | 213.4 / 346.5 | 10,650 / 24,328 | 110.9 (86.7-226.1) | 808.8 | 1.95 |
| c16 | 32 | 32 | 8 (25 %) | 27 | 2.62 | 260.2 / 443.4 | 13,152 / 23,653 | 87.9 (72.1-130.6) | 1133.0 | 2.91 |

DeepSeek L1 during the gates (30-60 s samples of vLLM `/metrics`, six DP
ranks): 175 tok/s generation at c1, 590-760 tok/s at c4-c8; DSpark
acceptance 51-63 %; prefix-cache hits 15.5 % of prompt tokens.

Findings (open):

- Guarantee rate on long InFoBench requests is 25-38 %; most unguaranteed
  answers fail requirements scored 0.7-0.99 against tau_hi 0.9966, or G1
  (per-claim groundedness, minimum over claims, not separately calibrated).
  Short constraint requests reach 81 %.
- Latency is dominated by internal tokens (thinking-high extraction and
  draft, repairs averaging 2.3-2.8 attempts): p50 141 s at c1, 260 s at
  c16. No latency target has been agreed yet.
- Defects found and fixed during the gates: G3 read JSON keys and code
  string literals as quotations; verbatim matching failed on typography;
  a report omitted requirements an early check failure left unread; the
  extractor read Kairyu's answer-contract wrapper; V4.1 thinks unless
  `enable_thinking: false` is sent.
