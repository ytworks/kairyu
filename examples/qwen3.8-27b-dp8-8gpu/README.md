# Qwen3.8-27B as 8 x TP1 replicas on 8 x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell

This example starts one public Qwen model backed by eight identical single-GPU
vLLM replicas with one command:

```text
Open WebUI -> Kairyu L3 (:8004; model qwen3.8-27b)
                -> Kairyu L2 replica pool (placement only, no orchestration)
                    -> 8 x vLLM L1, Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 TP1, one per GPU (GPU 0-7)
```

Clients see exactly one OpenAI-compatible model, `qwen3.8-27b`. Kairyu L2 does
nothing but choose a replica for each request, so the eight GPUs behave like
one server with eight times the capacity of the
[single-GPU example](../qwen3.8-27b-1gpu/README.md), whose measured L1
envelope every replica carries unchanged (official FP8 checkpoint, 262,144-token
context, FP8 KV cache, FP16 Gated-DeltaNet state, prefix caching, chunked
prefill, FlashInfer autotuning, piecewise CUDA Graphs, MTP off, and the same
adapted chat template mounted from that example). Ordinary requests default to
direct answers; an explicit `reasoning_effort` enables Qwen's thinking mode at
the fixed low effort level, as in the single-GPU example.

## How requests are spread over the replicas

The pool in [`kairyu.yaml`](kairyu.yaml) uses Kairyu's built-in placement
policy with two knobs set for even, efficient spreading:

- `prefix_index: true` — a request whose prompt prefix is already warm in a
  replica's KV cache (a multi-turn chat continuing on the same replica) goes
  back to that replica **only while it is idle**, so the cached prefix is
  reused instead of being prefilled again elsewhere.
- `queue_depth_threshold: 0` — the moment the preferred replica has one
  in-flight request, placement falls through to **least-outstanding**: the
  replica with the fewest in-flight requests wins, ties going to the lowest
  replica id. Concurrent traffic therefore lands one-per-replica before any
  replica takes a second request; strictly serial traffic uses replica 0.

A replica is eligible only after its readiness probe succeeds and is ejected
after one failed request (`unhealthy_after: 1`) until it probes healthy
again. Every placement decision is appended to the pool's placement log
(`placement_log_path`), which `verify.sh` reads to prove the distribution.

## Start

```sh
./run.sh
```

The command validates eight matching GPUs (indices 0-7), pins each replica to
its GPU's NUMA-local CPUs, prepares bind-backed storage below
`/mnt/nvme/kairyu`, pulls the digest-pinned official vLLM release if needed,
reuses the single-GPU example's attested checkpoint download (or downloads and
hashes it), builds Kairyu, waits for all ten services, checks that Kairyu
reports exactly one public model with eight healthy replicas, and prints:

```text
OpenAI API: http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1
Chat UI:    http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Model files live in `/mnt/nvme/kairyu/model-volumes/qwen3.8-27b-1gpu/models`
(shared with the single-GPU example); Open WebUI state, one vLLM compilation
cache per replica, and the placement log live below
`/mnt/nvme/kairyu/model-volumes/qwen3.8-27b-dp8-8gpu/`. Set
`NVME_STORAGE_ROOT` only to another absolute path below `/mnt/nvme`.
`VERIFY_MODEL=1 ./run.sh` rehashes the checkpoint. Lifecycle commands are
`./run.sh up`, `./run.sh status`, `./run.sh logs`, and `./run.sh down`.

## Serving verification

```sh
./verify.sh list
./verify.sh serving
```

`serving` warms every replica with one short request, then records TTFT,
TPOT, requests/s, and output tokens/s for fixed approximately 8K-token inputs
and exactly 256 generated tokens at concurrency 1, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (64
requests per row). Each row's prompts carry a row-unique prefix first, so
neither vLLM prefix caching nor Kairyu's prefix-aware placement can inflate the
matrix. For every row it also reads the placement log delta and writes
`placement.json` with the per-replica request counts; at concurrency >= 8 the
row **fails** unless every replica received traffic and no replica took more
than 1.25x the even share (10 of 64 requests). Artifacts go to
`/mnt/nvme/kairyu/model-volumes/qwen3.8-27b-dp8-8gpu/verification-results/<UTC-run-id>/`
(override with `VERIFICATION_RESULTS_ROOT`). The locked results are in
[MEASUREMENTS.md](MEASUREMENTS.md).

Model and product evaluations are invoked explicitly through `python -m evals`;
see the repository benchmark documentation for the retained evaluation suites.

## Reproducibility pins

- Model revision: `017b9c7af6b5689d5dd426a76e0bc077eb5ca20a`
- Model tree SHA-256: `9825ce119c9693172e04dd2a1f2437884503ceab9bf55606141e6662c9fe301e`
- vLLM release/source: `v0.23.0` / `0fc695fc6d1d82e9a5ac6835ac8e4e1c83703665`
- vLLM image digest: `sha256:6d8429e38e3747723ca07ee1b17972e09bb9c51c4032b266f24fb1cc3b22ed8f`
- Open WebUI: `v0.11.0-slim` plus the digest in `example.json`

Override API/UI ports with `API_PORT` and `CHAT_UI_PORT`. Override prebuilt
images with `QWEN_VLLM_IMAGE` or `OPEN_WEBUI_IMAGE`; a non-default vLLM
override must already exist locally. Dotenv files are ignored and credentials
are not written into evidence.

To expose the UI deliberately, keep the unauthenticated Kairyu API on loopback:

```sh
CHAT_UI_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 PUBLIC_HOST=<public-ip> \
WEBUI_URL=http://<public-ip>:3000 ENABLE_SIGNUP=false \
WEBUI_ADMIN_EMAIL=<email> WEBUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<strong-secret> ./run.sh up
```

Use TLS and a firewall or reverse proxy before exposing port 3000 publicly.
